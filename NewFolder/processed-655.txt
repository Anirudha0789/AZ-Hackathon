 there exist a dimensional rectangular field of  infinite length and breadth   n iron blocks are dropped onto this field from the sky at particular coordinates  however it is made sure that only one block is dropped at a particular coordinate   you are standing at a particular location x y of the field   you have a magnet with a power m in your hand  a magnet of power m at coordinates x y can attract an iron block at x y to its own location if maxabsx  x absy  y ≤ m  abs represents the absolute value function   given queries containing your position xy and the value k  your task is to find the minimum power of magnet you require to get at least k blocks to your own location   if it is not possible to get k blocks output  for that case    input first line of the input contains an integer n denoting number of blocks  then follow n lines ith line contains two integers x and y denoting the x and y coordinate of ith block next line contains an integer q denoting number of queries  then follow q lines each line contains three integers xy and k x and y denoting your position and k denoting the number of blocks you need to bring to your position  xa output q lines containing answers to each of the queries in the input xa constraints  ≤ n ≤   ≤ q  ≤   ≤ any x or y coordinate  ≤   ≤ k  ≤  xa example input                      output     xa explanation  query  using a magnet of power  block at   can be brought to     query  using a magnet of power  block at   can be brought to     query  using a magnet of power  blocks at   and   can be brought to      author ★amanmittal editorial  codechef comproblemsinsqh tags                                   amanmittal binarysearch dynamicprogramming insq                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages java c cpp pyp  submit
