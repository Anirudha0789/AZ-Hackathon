  eastern draughts is played on an nxn grid consisting of cells x y with  ≤ xy  n  some cells of the grid have pieces on them and no cell may ever have more than one piece at a time  the number of pieces will be equal to pp for some positive integer p ≤ n  there are two types of moves in the game a step consists of moving a piece from x y to x y x y x y x y x y or x y  the destination cell must be empty and must lie within the bounds of the grid  note that you cannot move a piece directly from x y to x y or x y  a jump consists of moving a piece from x y to x y x y x y x y x y or x y  not only must the destination cell be empty and lie within the bounds of the grid but the cell between the source and destination cells must contain a piece    a turn consists of either a single step or a sequence of one or more jumps where the same piece is moved with each jump  the goal is to move the pieces to the goal configuration in as few turns as possible  the goal configuration is such that each cell x y contains a piece if and only if xy  p  for this problem you do not need to use as few turns as possible but the fewer turns you use the higher your score will be   input  input will begin with an integer n the size of the grid  n lines follow with n characters each giving the initial positions of the pieces  a  indicates a piece and a   indicates an empty cell  the upperleft corner is   upperright corner is n  bottomleft corner is  n and bottomright corner n n   output  first output an integer l the number of moves in your solution not number of turns  then output l lines each formatted as x y x y where x y is the source cell and x y is the destination cell   l must be less than one million   scoring  let k be the number of turns in your solution and let s be the sum of xy over all cells initially containing pieces and r be the sum of xy over all cells containing pieces in the goal configuration  then your score for each test case is s  rk  your overall score is the average of your scores on the individual input files   sample input                       sample output                       sample input                               sample output                                           the sample output uses  turns on the first test case and  on the second  the sequence of turns on the second test case is                                                for the first test case s   and r   and for the second case s   and r    thus the score for the first test case is      and the score for the second test case is        the overall score is          test case generation n is chosen randomly and uniformly between  and  inclusive   p is chosen randomly and uniformly between  and n inclusive   pp cells are chosen at random for pieces   you may safely assume there will be no test cases where the starting configuration is equal to the goal configuration   author davidadm editorial  codechef comproblemscheckers tags                                   aug challenge davidadm graphs                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit      secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
