 there is an array of length n consisting of nonnegative integers  the array is sorted in nondecreasing order  each number in the array appears exactly k times except one element which appears at least once but less than k times  your task is to identify that element  this is an interactive problem  you are only given the integer n in the input  both the array and the value of k are hidden  you are allowed to ask the judge the following queries what is the value of the element at index i of the array identify the value of the element with frequency less than k by asking at most  such queries  input and output the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  for each test case you should start by reading a single line containing one integer n from the input  you can interact with the judge using the standard input and output  there are two types of operations to perform one operation you should print to the standard output a line containing two spaceseparated integers type and val   if type   you are asking the judge a query for the value of the element of the array at index val  after printing this line the judge will print to the standard input a line containing one integer corresponding to the value of the element at index val   if type   you are telling the judge that the element with frequency less than k is val  for each test case you should perform this operation exactly once at the end  this is not counted towards the  queries   note dont forget to flush the standard output after printing each line  it can be done using fflushstdout in cc system out flush in java and sys out flush in python  if you ask more than  queries your program will get the verdict wrong answer  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ k ≤ n   each element of the array lies between  and  inclusive  example input  judge feedbacktyour output   tttttt   tttttt   tttttt   tttttt   explanation example case  suppose the array is     note that the value of k is  but it is hidden from you  in the first query you request the value of the nd element and the judge answers   then you request the value of the rd element and the judge answers  then the value of the first element and the judge answers   now you tell the judge that the answer is   you made a total of  queries   author admin editorial  codechef comproblemselhidarr tags                                   case work binary search                                                              special algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
