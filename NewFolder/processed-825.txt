 chef has an array of n numbers and a magic function which can swap two array values if their distance is strictly greater than k units  since his friend pishty is obsessed with sorted array chef wants to make the lexicographically minimum array possible by using this magic function  he can use this magic function any number of times  help him find the solution distance absolute difference of indiceslexicographically minimum given two arrays pp… pr and qq… qr of same length the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order if pi   qi for the first i where pi and qi differ    input first line of input contains two space separated integers n and k next line contains n space separated integers a a     an denoting chefs array  output the only line of output contains n space separated integers denoting the lexicographically minimum array possible after all such possible swap operations   constraints  ≤ nk ≤   ≤ ai ≤  xa                          sample input                                                             sample output                                  explanation in the first operation chef can use his magic function to swap  and  since their distance   greater than   new array formed      similarly he can now swap  and  to obtain      finally he can swap  and  to obain       this is the lexicographically minimum array possible    author ★gvaibhav editorial  codechef comproblemsstswap tags                                   easy gvaibhav inso insomnia sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
