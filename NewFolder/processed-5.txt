 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are participating in a contest which has  problems numbered  through   the first eight problems i e  problems …… are scorable while the last three problems   and  are nonscorable ― this means that any submissions you make on any of these problems do not affect your total score  your total score is the sum of your best scores for all scorable problems  that is for each scorable problem you look at the scores of all submissions you made on that problem and take the maximum of these scores or  if you didnt make any submissions on that problem the total score is the sum of the maximum scores you took  you know the results of all submissions you made  calculate your total score  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn denoting the number of submissions you made  nn lines follow  for each ii ≤i≤n≤i≤n the iith of these lines contains two spaceseparated integers pipi and sisi denoting that your iith submission was on problem pipi and it received a score sisi   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― your total score  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤pi≤≤pi≤ for each valid ii ≤si≤≤si≤ for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points all submissions are on the same problem i e  pp…pnpp…pn subtask   points there is at most one submission made on each problem i e  pi≠pjpi≠pj for each valid ijij i≠ji≠j subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                    sample output                              explanation example case  the scorable problems with at least one submission are problems  and   for problem  there are two submissions and the maximum score among them is   for problem  there are also two submissions and the maximum score is   hence the total score is   example case  no scorable problem is attempted so the total score is    author vijjuadm editorial  codechef comproblemswatscore tags                                   arrays implementation                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
