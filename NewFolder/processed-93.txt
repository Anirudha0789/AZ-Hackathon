 xa suyash was provided with an array of length n initially filled with ’s  later he was given q  queries each with three parameters l r  w where w is the weight that has to be added to  each element of the array in the index range l to r index is  based  he was asked to  execute all the queries and return the final array  since suyash was  busy in some other task  he called for your help xa input xa first line contains two integers n and q   next q lines contains three integers l r and w   xa output the final resultant output array xathe elements of the resultant array should be seperated by spaces   constraints  ≤ n q w ≤    ≤ l r ≤ n  xa example input               output       xa explanation example case   intitally the array is      after addition of  to all elements from range  to  elements are       after addition of  to all elements from range  to  elements are        author ★saquibhere editorial  codechef comproblemscoinsm tags                                   array saquibhere                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
