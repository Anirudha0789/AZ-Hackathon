 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese russian vietnamese and bengali as well  you are given two strings ss and rr  each of these strings has length nn  we want to make ss equal to rr by performing the following operation some number of times possibly zero  choose two integers aa and bb such that ≤a≤b≤n≤a≤b≤n  for each ii such that a≤i≤ba≤i≤b replace the iith character of ss by the iith character of rr   suppose that we make ss equal to rr by performing this operation kk times in such a way that the total number of replaced characters i e  the sum of all kk values of b−ab−a is ll  then the cost of this process is defined as k⋅lk⋅l  find the minimum cost with which we can make ss equal to rr  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single string ss  the second line contains a single string rr   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum cost  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ srnsrn ss and rr contain only lowercase english letters the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅                         sample input                             adefb bdefa                          sample output                             explanation example case  ss can be made equal to rr in two moves  first we replace ss by rr and then replace ss by rr  we have klkl so the cost is ⋅⋅  if we wanted to perform only one operation the cost would be    author ★rumblefool editorial  codechef comproblemsminops tags                                   greedy implementation                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
