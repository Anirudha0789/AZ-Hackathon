 after his marriage when one day chef was talking to his wife he found that she liked a lot of riddles  one day she told him about power of a string and asked him to solve a problem for her   his wife told him the following things about the kthkth power of a string  the kthkth power of a string ii is denoted as ikik and this string ikik is obtained by concatenating kk copies of the string ii  this means that ikik iikik i where   denotes concatenation and i is an empty string  the chef is given a string ss it is required to measure how ‘far’ it is from the kth power of some string  the chef is only allowed to replace some characters in the string by others  the chef is also given a number kk it is required for him to find the minimum number of replacements needed so that the resulting string is the kth power of some string  it can be assumed that the length of the given string is a multiple of kk  help chef to find the minimum number of replacements   input the first line of input will contain the given string  it can be assumed that the characters in the string are all small letters a   za   z  the second line of input will contain a number k≥k≥ that divides the length of the string   output the first line of output should contain the answer the minimum number of replacements needed to convert the string into a kthkth power  constraints  length of ss kk time limit is around  seconds                                                                                   sample input  abaababa                                                                                    sample input  abcabcab                                                                                                                                      sample output   sample output   explanation for sample test  here k therefore we have to find minimum replacement in  strings ab aa ba and ba to make them all equal so we can see that the number of replacements will be  we can make them all equal to ba explanation for sample test  here k therefore there are  strings abca and bcab we have to make both strings equal so we can make both of them equal to abca  so the number of replacements are   change all characters of nd string bcab to abca  author ★beast editorial  codechef comproblemschefstri tags                                   beast greedy math medium strings                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
