 ram is trying to fill nn buckets of water numbered from  to nn   each of these buckets ii  ≤i≤n≤i≤n have capacity cici and it needs to be filled with cici liters of water  he has a special water hose which has a really useful feature  at each turn when ram aims this hose at any bucket and presses the hose trigger this hose will throw xx liters of water at that bucket which it is aimed at and yy liters of water at all other n−n− buckets  also it is guaranteed that yxyx now ram wonders what is the minimum number of turns in which ram will be able to fill all buckets with water  note its okay if water is overflowing in some bucket  see test case for explanation   input  the first line will have an integer tt the number of test cases  the first line of each testcase will have  integers nn  xx and yy  next line will have nn space separated integers where the ithith integer denotes cici  output  print on a single line the minimum number of turns needed to fill all buckets fully with water  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤cixy≤≤cixy≤ sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed  sample input                   sample output    sample test explanation for testcase  ram can fill all bucket in a single turn  he will just aim hose at th bucket and fill it with  liter of water  and simultaneously  the remaining  buckets will be filled with  liters of water   for testcase   a possible approach to fill in two turns is   aim hose at th bucket and after that  only the rd bucket will be left to fill with  liter of water  it can be done in the next step  or another approach is  aim hose at rd bucket and after that  both rd bucket and nd bucket will be left to fill with  liter of water each  it can be done in the next step by aiming at any bucket   author ★pritishn editorial  codechef comproblemsbgl tags                                   binarysearch pritishn                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
