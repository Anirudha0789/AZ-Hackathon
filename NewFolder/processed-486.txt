 read problem statements in bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given a binary string ss  chef defines mexsmexs as the smallest nonnegative integer such that its binary representation without leading s in particular the binary representation of  is  is not a subsequence of ss  chef is asking you to find mexsmexs  since this integer could be very large find its binary representation without leading s  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first and only line of each test case contains a single string ss   output for each test case print a single line containing one string mexsmexs in binary representation  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤s≤≤s≤ ss contains only characters  and  the sum of ss over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅  subtasks subtask   points   ≤t≤⋅≤t≤⋅ s≤s≤  subtask   points   ≤t≤≤t≤ s≤s≤  subtask   points  original constraints                         sample input                                                        sample output                              explanation example case  all integers between  and  inclusive in binary representation appear in ss as subsequences  however the binary representation of  which is  is not a subsequence of ss  example case  since ss contains only s the string  is not a subsequence of ss and therefore mexsmexs   author ★avijeet editorial  codechef comproblemsmexstr tags                                   dynamic programming subsequence                                                              data structures arrays algorithms groupings                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
