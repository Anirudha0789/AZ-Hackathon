 marios bullet moves at xx pixels per frame  he wishes to shoot a goomba standing yy pixels away from him  the goomba does not move  find the minimum time in seconds after which mario should shoot the bullet such that it hits the goomba after at least zz seconds from now  input format  the first line of input will contain an integer tt the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  each test case consists of a single line of input containing three spaceseparated integers xyxy and zz   output format for each test case output in a single line the minimum time in seconds after which mario should shoot the bullet such that it hits the goomba after at least zz seconds from now  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤xyz≤≤xyz≤ xx divides yy                         sample input                                                               sample output                               explanation test case  the speed of the bullet is  pixels per frame and the goomba is  pixels away from mario  thus it would take  second for the bullet to reach the goomba  mario wants the bullet to reach goomba after at least  seconds  so he should fire the bullet after  seconds  test case  the speed of the bullet is  pixels per frame and the goomba is  pixels away from mario  thus it would take  seconds for the bullet to reach the goomba  mario wants the bullet to reach the goomba after at least  second  so he should fire the bullet after  seconds  note that this is the minimum time after which he can shoot a bullet  test case  the speed of the bullet is  pixels per frame and the goomba is  pixels away from mario  thus it would take  seconds for the bullet to reach the goomba  mario wants the bullet to reach goomba after at least  seconds  so he should fire the bullet after  seconds   author ★notsoloud editorial  codechef comproblemsbullet tags                                   cakewalk cakewalk greedy greedy ltime ltime math math notsoloud                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
