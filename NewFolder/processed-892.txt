 every story has a endgame   but there are some untold stories   this is one of those stories  captain borrowed ss infinity stones from their respective timelines to defeat archon  evil omni king of anime war  now captain wants to return all the infinity stones in their respective timelines  let us denote dimensions of  time and space  as xx and yy coordinate   captain can only move forward either in time or in space to move into another timeline  captain must visit all coordinates  which consist of an infinity stone   two timelines are considered to be different if they have different time and space dimensions  he cannot go back in time or space  their are kk timelines in which thanos lived   in these timelines thanos is inevitable  if captain visits either of these timelines then thanos will kill the captain  so captain has to avoid these timelines    doctor strange is busy in fighting with dormammu  so doctor strange asked you to find the total no  of paths by which captain can return the infinity stones and come back safely  since this number can be huge compute it modulo        initially captain is at timeline xinitialyinitialxinitialyinitial and he has to reach xfinalyfinalxfinalyfinal   as only these two timelines are same in whole time world   input  first line contains tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   each testcase contains several lines of input             first line contains  four space separated integers xinitialyinitialxfinalyfinalxinitialyinitialxfinalyfinal  second line contains two space separated integers sksk                  next ss lines contains two space separated integers aibiaibi denoting coordinate of ithith infinity stone                 next kk lines contains two space separated integers aibiaibi denoting  ithith  coordinate in which thanos lives                    output  for each testcase  output  −− if captain cannot  safely reach the destination in particular if number of paths is  output −−  else output in a single line no  of safe paths by which captain can reach destination modulo    constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤sk≤≤sk≤ ≤xinitialxfinal≤≤xinitialxfinal≤ ≤yinitialyfinal≤≤yinitialyfinal≤  ≤aibi≤≤aibi≤ xinitialxinitial  aiai   xfinalxfinal yinitialyinitial  bibi   yfinalyfinal aibiaibixinitialyinitialxfinalyfinalaibiaibixinitialyinitialxfinalyfinal  are pairwise distinct    sample input                                                                                                                                                            sample output           explanation  test case  possible path  →  →  captain cant visit   because thanos lives there                test case  there is no possible path from  to  because  →  and  →  both paths are invalid as captain cant visit  and  because thanos lives there    author ★avenger editorial  codechef comproblemscocr tags                                   avenger combinatorics cros maths mediumhard sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
