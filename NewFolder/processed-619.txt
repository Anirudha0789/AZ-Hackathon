 you are given an integer array aa  of size nn and an integer value kk  find the number of subarrays of aa such that the difference between maximum value and minimum value in the sub array is less than or equal to kk  subarray is a contiguous portion of an array and two subarrays are different if their starting index or ending index is not same  input  first line will contain two integers nn and kk size of the array and the difference threshold   second line contains nn space separated integers representing the array elements    output print a single integer the number of subarrays satisfying the above mentioned condition  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤kai≤≤kai≤  sample input       sample output   explanation the subarrays which satisfy the condition are    difference    difference    difference    difference     author ★murugappans editorial  codechef comproblemskmaxmin tags                                   binarysearch ccpc mediumhard murugappans rangeminimumquery segmenttree sparsetable                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
