 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef loves to play with iron fe and magnets ma  he took a row of nn cells numbered  through nn and placed some objects in some of these cells  you are given a string ss with length nn describing them for each valid ii the iith character of ss is one of the following  i if the iith cell contains a piece of iron m if the iith cell contains a magnet  if the iith cell is empty  if the iith cell contains a conducting sheet x if the iith cell is blocked  if there is a magnet in a cell ii and iron in a cell jj the attraction power between these cells is pijk−j−i−sijpijk−j−i−sij where sijsij is the number of cells containing sheets between cells ii and jj  this magnet can only attract this iron if pijpij and there are no blocked cells between the cells ii and jj  chef wants to choose some magnets possibly none and to each of these magnets assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract  each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them  find the maximum number of magnets chef can choose  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and kk  the second line contains a single string ss with length nn   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ss contains only characters i m   and x the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅  subtasks subtask   points there are no sheets i e  ss does not contain the character  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                               im   mimxiim                          sample output                              explanation example case  the attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is −−−−  note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets  example case  the magnets in cells  and  can attract the piece of iron in cell  since the attraction power is  in both cases  they cannot attract iron in cells  or  because there is a wall between them  the magnet in cell  can attract the pieces of iron in cells  and  the attraction power is  and  respectively   author ★acoderhack editorial  codechef comproblemsfema tags                                   queues implementation                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
