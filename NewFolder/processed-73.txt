  one day chefs friend gave him a sequence aaaa     an  he told chef to find the length of the longest appearing  even sequence  an even sequence is a sequence formed with only consecutive even numberse g      is an even sequence but     is not  but the twist is that firstly  he wants chef to convert the sequence in a specified form where b bb b           upto n terms and then find the length  of the longest appearing even sequence  note if there are multiple sequence possible take the one thats lexicographically smallest   input  the first line of input contains one integer n denoting the numbers of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of element in the sequence   the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an denoting the elements of the sequence  output output a single line containing the length of the longest appearing even sequence   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ ai ≤  example input               example output   explanation example case the given sequence can be converted to           etc   but well take the lexicographically smallest one i e          now we can see the longest appearing even sequence in the new sequence is   example case similarly as case  the lexicographically smallest sequence is       and the lenght of the longest appearing even sequence is     author ★rahulojha editorial  codechef comproblemschfwv tags                                   array rahulojha                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit    secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
