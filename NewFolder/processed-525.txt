  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given n points on d plane  you have to find out minimal radius of a circle which contains at least m of these points   input first line of the input contains two space separated integer n and m  each of the next n lines contains two space separated real numbers denoting the x and y coordinates of ith point i e  xi yi  these numbers with not contain more than  digits after decimal point   output output a single floating point number corresponding to the minimal radius of a circle with at least m of the above points  your answer will be considered correct iff its absolute error does not exceed more than   constraints   ≤ m ≤ n ≤   ≤ xi yi ≤   subtasks  subtask   points  ≤ n ≤  subtask   points  ≤ n ≤   example  input          output    author ★mgch tester ★iscsi editorial  codechef comproblemschefcirc tags                                   sweep line algorithm binary search                                                              advanced algorithms computational geometry algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
