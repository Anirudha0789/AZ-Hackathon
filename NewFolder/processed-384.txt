 you play the following game against a devilishly clever opponent  on the table there are two bowls ﬁlled with glass beads  in each move depending on whose turn it is you or your opponent can do one of the following   move one bead from the ﬁrst bowl to the second bowl  remove one bead from the second bowl   at any point in the game let xx denote the number of beads in the ﬁrst bowl and yy denote the number of beads in the second bowl  if xyxy is even it is your turn to move  if xyxy is odd it is your opponent’s turn to move at each position of the game you get some points that depend on the number of beads xx and yy in the two bowls  this is given by a function fxyaxbycxyfxyaxbycxy where abab and cc are integers that are ﬁxed each time the game is played  the game starts with mm beads in the ﬁrst bowl and nn beads in the second bowl  as the game progresses beads are removed  the game ends when both bowls are empty  your score for the game is the sum of the values fxyfxy for each position xyxy that the game passes through starting from mnmn and ending with   your aim is to obtain as high a score as possible no matter what moves your opponent chooses  remember that your opponent is ﬁendishly ingenious and will always play in such a way as to minimize your score  for example  suppose the game starts with  beads in each bowl and the score function is fxyx−y−xyfxyx−y−xy  that is ab−ab− and c−c−  here are some plays of the game—the positions where you choose the move are enclosed in boxes and the positions where your opponent moves are not enclosed in boxes   in this particular game the best possible score that you can achieve if you consider all possible moves that your opponent can choose is −−  recall that your devilishly clever opponent always plays in such a way that your score is minimized  input format the input consists of a single line containing ﬁve integers mnabmnab and cc where mm and nn are the number of beads initially in the ﬁrst and second bowl respectively and abab and cc are the coefficients of the score function fxyaxbycxyfxyaxbycxy output format the output should be a single integer the maximum score that you can achieve in this game  constraints  ≤nm≤≤nm≤ −≤abc≤−≤abc≤  subtasks  subtask   points original constraints                         sample input                                                          sample output                             explanation explained in statement  author ★yogesh tags                                   mathematics dynamic programming                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
