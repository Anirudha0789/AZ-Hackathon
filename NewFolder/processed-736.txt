  sereja has an array which consists of n integers  let the integers be denoted by a a     an  sereja has just started learning about sorting  sereja wrote a program which takes input of an index idx and then sorts the elements of serejas array which satisfy  ai  idx ≤ i  minn   idx  k    now sereja wants to solve the more interesting problem of sorting the original array  but sereja is not very keen on writing more programs  so he asks you to write a program that provides input to his program so that his array is sorted  he shall be more pleased if you sort his array in as few operations where an operation is one invocation of serejas program as possible  input  the first line of the input contains an integer t the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains integers n and k  n is then length of serejas array for that test case  k is the size of the block that is sorted whenever serejas program is invoked with an index  the second line of each test case contains integers a a     an  output  this is a challenge problem hence the output specification is very strict  make sure you produce output exactly as described here otherwise you will get a verdict of wrong answer    for each test case the first line contains an integer q the number of times you want to invoke serejas program for that test case  q must be an integer between  and nnk   inclusive  on the next line print exactly q space separated integers q q     qn  make sure that each qi falls exactly in the range n  the order in which the integers appear is the order in which they will be used to step by step invoke serejas program and sort the subarrays  refer to the next section on scoring to know how your output is scored  it is important to note that for each test file you have to successfully sort at least one of the serejas arrays i e  for at least one test case the given array should be sorted in the end of all the calls  failure to do so will result in a wrong answer verdict  scoring  if your program solves a test case it receives the score of q  k for that test case  solving a test case means that the given array should have been successfully sorted in the end  otherwise the test case is considered not solved  in this case your program receives a score of  for that test case  the total score for a test file is the sum of scores of each test case in the file  the total score of the program is simply the sum of the scores for each test files divided by the number of test files this is what the generic master judge does  since the number of test files are same for everyone this is effectively equal to the sum of scores for all the test files  in case it isnt apparent yet the objective of this problem is to minimize your total score  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ k ≤ n  ≤ ai ≤  you may assume there is always some way to sort the array within nnk   calls sample input                         output             the above sample will receive a score of          author serejaadm tester ★gamabunta editorial  codechef comproblemsseasor tags                                   adhoc challenge july serejaadm sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
