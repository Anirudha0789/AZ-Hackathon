 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese  in chefland there are nn cities numbered  through nn connected by n−n− bidirectional roads  each city has exactly one garden  for each valid ii lets denote the population of the iith city by aiai and the initial number of fruits in its garden by bibi also at any time lets denote the current number of fruits in its garden by fifi fibifibi initially  you are given a permutation pp of the integers  through nn  for each ii ≤i≤n≤i≤n during the iith of the next nn days the people of the city pipi do the following  for each city jj which is reachable from the city pipi including the city pipi itself visit the city jj and consume minapifjminapifj fruits from the garden of the city jj afterwards fjfj decreases by minapifjminapifj  return to the city pipi and cut off all the roads that are connecting it to other cities so that nobody can visit the city pipi or visit any other city from their city if it requires passing through the city pipi   for each valid ii let didi be the first day when the number of fruits in the iith citys garden becomes zero or −− if the fruits in its garden never end up all eaten  find dd…dndd…dn  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  each of the next n−n− lines contains two spaceseparated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge  the next line contains nn spaceseparated integers pp…pnpp…pn  the next line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an  the last line contains nn spaceseparated integers bb…bnbb…bn   output for each test case print a single line containing nn spaceseparated integers dd…dndd…dn  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n ≤pi≤n≤pi≤n for each valid ii ≤aibi≤≤aibi≤ for each valid ii the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅  subtasks subtask   points  n≤n≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                                  sample output                                  explanation example case  the process is as follows  on day  people from city  eat  fruit from each garden  afterwards there are  fruits in the gardens of cities  respectively so the answer for city  is  since the number of fruits in this garden becomes zero on day   then on day  people from city  eat  fruits from each of the gardens in cities  and   afterwards there are  fruits in the garden of city  so the answer for city  is  since the number of fruits in this garden becomes zero on this day and  fruits in the garden of city   finally on day  people from city  eat  fruits from the garden of city  so the answer for city  is     author ★rishupnitdgp editorial  codechef comproblemschefcomp tags                                   trees disjoint set union dfs binary search prefix sum                                                              data structures graphs advanced data structures algorithms graph algos traversals searching simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
