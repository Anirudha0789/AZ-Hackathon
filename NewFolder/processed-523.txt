 churu got an assignment in his class to compute the count of elements floating point decimals greater than k if the list of non repeating elements was sorted  churu has solved the problem but he needs to verify with someone  become churus tester by computing the answer for each queries   input  first line contains t the number of test cases  first line of each test case contains n denoting the number of elements in list  second line of each test case contains q denoting the number of queries in the assignment  next line contains n spaceseperated elements ai   next q lines contains a single element k from the list   output  verify churus answers by computing the answer for each query  constraints and subtasks    t     n q  e   ai  e  subtask   points    n q    subtask   points    n q    subtask   points  original constraints   example input                    output    author â˜…adigalaxyak editorial  codechef comproblemscdva tags                                   adhoc adigalaxyak binarysearch cdva                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit    secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
