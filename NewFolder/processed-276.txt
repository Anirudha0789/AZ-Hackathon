  read problems statements in mandarin chinese and russian as well  mike takes part in programming contests  his favourite topic is dynamic programmingdp  as he said that he likes problems on dp because you spend a lot of time on thinking and a little time on coding  in this problem you are to solve a version of the knapsack problemlink one of the most famous examples of dp problem  you are given n items each has two parameters a weight and a cost  lets define m as the sum of the weights of all the items  your task is to determine the most expensive cost of a knapsack which capacity equals to       m  a cost of a knapsack equals to the sum of the costs of all the elements of the knapsack  also when you have a knapsack with a capacity is equal to c then you can fill it with items whose sum of weights is not greater than c  input the first line of the input contains one integer n denoting the number of the items  the next n lines contain two integers w and c each denoting the weight and the cost of the corresponding item  output for each capacity c  ≤ c ≤ m of the knapsack output a single integer  the most expensive cost for that capacity  constraints  ≤ n ≤   ≤ w ≤  for each item  ≤ c ≤  for each item  example input             output            explanations in the test case m equals to   for c   its optimal to choose  items for c   its optimal to choose  items for c   its optimal to choose   items for c   its optimal to choose   items for c   its optimal to choose    items for c   its optimal to choose    items for c   its optimal to choose     items for c   its optimal to choose     items for c   its optimal to choose      items   author ★kostyaby tester ★rustinpiece editorial  codechef comproblemsknpsk tags                                   greedy sorting                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
