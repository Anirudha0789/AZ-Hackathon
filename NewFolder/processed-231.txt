 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and bengali as well  you are given an array aa of nn elements  you can do the following operations on that array  remove the leftmost element of the array with index ll for the cost alal  this can be done any number of times if the array is nonempty has at least  element  remove the rightmost element of the array with index rr for the cost arar  this can be done any number of times if the array is nonempty has at least  element  remove both the leftmost and rightmost element with indexes ll and rr respectively for a fixed cost xx which is given  this operation can only be done kk times and only if the array has at least  elements left   if the array has only  element left then the rightmost element is the same as the leftmost element so the first and second operations will have the same cost  you have to print the minimum cost to clear the array remove all elements using one of the three operations above  note the answer may not fit in bit integers so please use bit data types in your programming language  input format  the first line of the input contains tt  the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  each test case contains  lines of input  the first line of each test case contains three integers nn kk and xx separated by spaces  the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated positive integers aa…anaa…an   output format for each test case output on one line the minimum cost to clear the array  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤⌊n⌋≤k≤⌊n⌋ ≤x≤≤x≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤                         sample input                                                                              sample output                               explanation for the first test case we can remove aa for cost  which makes the array   then we can do the third operation to remove  and  for cost  which makes the array   we can again do the third operation to remove  and  for cost  which clears the array  the total cost is therefore  which is the minimum cost possible   author ★visheshs editorial  codechef comproblemscleararr tags                                   cook cook easy easy greedy greedy sorting sorting visheshs                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
