 guruji wants to explain the rahasya of satyug project to gaitonde  but to understand this project gaitonde needs to solve a problem  the problem describes there are q queries each query contains integer n  string s should be obtained by appending each integer  to n     if n then s   gaitonde have to find the sum of nth digit of string s  in each queries  since gaitonde is not good at problemsolving so he gave you to solve this problem for him  input the first line contains only integer q  number of queries then next q line contains integer n  output print the sum of integer obtained in each queries  constraints  ≤q≤≤q≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  subtasks  points≤q≤≤n≤points≤q≤≤n≤ pointspoints original constraints   sample input              sample output      explanation in first query ns th digit of s is  and second query ns th digit of s is   so final sum is    author ★rohan editorial  codechef comproblemsrhsat tags                                   bruteforce coha greedy implementation rohan strings                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
