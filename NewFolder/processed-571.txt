 a tree is an undirected connected graph without any cycles  you are given a tree with n nodes and a parameter k  each node in the node has a positive weight w  the tree needs to be partitioned into at most k subtrees by removing at most k edges such that the maximum weight of the resulting subtrees is as small as possible  find that smallest value of the maximum subtree weight that can be obtained by removing at most k edges  input first line contains n the number of nodes in the tree and k the number of subtrees  next line contains n integers denoting weights of the nodes  the ith integer denotes wi  next there are n lines with  integers each denoting the edges in the tree    output output a single integer the answer   constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ k ≤ n  ≤ wi ≤   xa example input           input          output   output  xa explanation example case   we can break the edge between  and  example case   we can break both the edges  author ★harrypotter tags                                   binarysearch depthfirstsearch harrypotter trees                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
