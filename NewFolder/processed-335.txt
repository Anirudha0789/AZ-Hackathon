 you are given a binary string aa of length nn  rearrange the binary string to form binary strings ss and tt such that the length of the longest common substring between ss and tt is minimum  print both strings ss and tt  note that both ss and tt must be anagrams of aa — see the examples below for more clarity  input format  the first line of input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  each test case consists of two lines  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn — the length of the binary string aa  the second line of each test case contains a binary string aa of length nn   output format  for each test case output two lines  the first line contains string ss while the second line contains string tt  both strings ss and tt must be anagrams of string aa and thus have length nn   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ sum of nn over all cases does not exceed    subtasks subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                            sample output                                  explanation test case  the given string is aa  two rearrangements of aa such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are ss and tt  the longest common substring between strings ss and tt is  having length   it can be proved that for no other pair of rearrangements of string aa the lcs has a length less than   test case  the given string is aa  here all rearrangements of aa are the same  two rearrangements of aa such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are ss and tt  the longest common substring between strings ss and tt is  having length   test case  the given string is aa  two rearrangements of aa such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are ss and tt  the longest common substring between strings ss and tt is  having length   it can be proved that for no other pair of rearrangements of string aa the lcs has a length less than    author ★notsoloud editorial  codechef comproblemsminsub tags                                   easymedium greedy march notsoloud pigeonhole strings substring                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
