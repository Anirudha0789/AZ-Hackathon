 young luffy is on a quest to become the king of the pirates  for that to happen he has to choose two comrades who will help him accomplish this goal  he has a group of n battlehardened pirates to choose from  all the n pirates can be represented as a hierarchy of rooted tree where pirate  is the boss of all pirates  you are also given the battle power of all the pirates in form of an array  the nakama power of a pirate is defined as the sum of all nakama power of the people included in his subtree plus his own battle power  in short the nakama power of any leaf node pirate is equal to his battle power  the attitude ratio between any two pirates is defined as the absolute difference between their nakama power  your task is to help luffy choose two comrades from the list of n pirates such that the attitude ratio between them is minimum possible  input  first line of input contains nn the number of pirates  next n−n− lines of input contain  spaceseparated integers xx yy where pirate xx and yy have a bidirectional relation between them  next line of input contains nn spaceseparated integers such that bibi is the battle power of ithith pirate   output it should contain a single integer denoting the minimum attitude ratio between any two pirates   constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤bi≤≤bi≤  subtasks   points  the given tree is a star graph  points  the given tree is a path graph  points  original constraints  sample input                        sample output   explanation the tree can be represented as  the nakama power of each pirates are  nabnab it is a leaf node so its nakama power is equal to its battle power  nabnab it is a leaf node so its nakama power is equal to its battle power  nabnab it is a leaf node so its nakama power is equal to its battle power  nabnab it is a leaf node so its nakama power is equal to its battle power  nabnab it is a leaf node so its nakama power is equal to its battle power  nabnanananabnanana it will be the sum of all nodes in its subtree as well its own battle power  nabnanananananabnanananana it will be the sum of all nodes in its subtree as well its own battle power  nabnananananananabnananananana it will be the sum of all nodes in its subtree as well its own battle power  as you can see node  and  have a minimum difference of   so the output is    author ★nihal editorial  codechef comproblemskazoku tags                                   depthfirstsearch easymedium greedy imti nihal trees                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
