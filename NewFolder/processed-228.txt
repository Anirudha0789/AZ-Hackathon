 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  vivek was quite bored with the lockdown so he came up with an interesting task  he successfully completed this task and now he would like you to solve it  you are given two strings aa and bb each with length nn  lets index the characters in each string from  ― for each ii ≤in≤in the iith characters of aa and bb are denoted by aiai and bibi respectively  you should convert aa to bb by performing operations of the following type  choose a subset ss of the set …n−…n−  let cc be the alphabetically smallest character among axax for all x∈sx∈s  for each x∈sx∈s replace axax by cc   you should find the smallest necessary number of operations or report that it is impossible to convert aa to bb  if it is possible you also need to find one way to convert aa to bb using this smallest number of operations  if there are multiple solutions you may find any one  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the second line contains a single string aa  the third line contains a single string bb   output for each test case  if it is impossible to convert aa to bb print a single line containing the integer −−  otherwise first print a line containing a single integer kk ― the minimum number of operations  then print kk lines describing the operations  each of these lines should contain a positive integer zz followed by a space and zz pairwise distinct spaceseparated integers from the set …n−…n− ― the elements of ss   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ abnabn aa and bb contain only lowercase english letters  subtasks subtask   points bb contains only characters a and b subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                              abcab aabab  aaa aab  de cd                          sample output                                       explanation example case   first we can choose ss so the character cc is b and the string aa after this operation is abbab  then we choose ss so cc is a and aa becomes aabab  there is no way to convert aa to bb in only one operation   example case  we can see that it is impossible to convert aa to bb since cc is always a  example case  we can see again that it is impossible to convert aa to bb since cc cannot be c   author ★vivek editorial  codechef comproblemsconvstr tags                                   string                                                              data structures                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
