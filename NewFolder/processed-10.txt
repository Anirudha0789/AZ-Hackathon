 alice has recently learned in her economics class that the market is said to be in equilibrium when the supply is equal to the demand  alice has market data for nn time points in the form of two integer arrays ss and dd  here sisi denotes the supply at the ithith point of time and didi denotes the demand at the ithith point of time for each ≤i≤n≤i≤n  help alice in finding out the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium   input format  the first line of input will contain an integer tt — the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  each test case contains three lines of input  the first line of each test case contains an integer nn the length of the arrays ss and dd  the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers ss…snss…sn  the third line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers dd…dndd…dn    output format for each test case output the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤sidi≤≤sidi≤ for every ≤i≤n≤i≤n                         sample input                                                                        sample output                              explanation test case  for ii and ii we have supply equal to demand hence the market is in equilibrium  test case  for ii we have supply equal to demand hence the market is in equilibrium   author utkarshadm editorial  codechef comproblemsecoclass tags                                   array cakewalk implementation start utkarshadm                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
