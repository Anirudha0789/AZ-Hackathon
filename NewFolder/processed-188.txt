 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese russian vietnamese and bengali as well  you are given a string ss with length nn  determine if it is possible to find two nonempty strings aa and bb which satisfy the following conditions  absabs where  denotes string concatenation bb is a substring of aa  note bb is a substring of aa if bb can be obtained from aa by deleting several possibly zero characters from the beginning and several possibly zero characters from the end  for example ab is a substring of cabd but ad is not  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the second line contains a single string ss   output for each test case print a single line containing the string yes if it is possible to find strings aa and bb satisfying the given conditions or no otherwise without quotes  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ snsn ss contains only lowercase english letters the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed                          sample input                              cabdab  yourcrushlovesyouback  wubbalubbadubdub  split  splitit                          sample output                            yes no yes no yes explanation example case  we can choose cabd as aa and ab as bb  we can see that absabs and bb is a substring of aa  example case  it is impossible to find two strings which satisfy the constraints  for example when aa is yourcrushlovesyou and bb is back then absabs but bb is not a substring of aa  example case  we can choose wubbalubbadub as aa and dub as bb   author ★sjshohag editorial  codechef comproblemssplitit tags                                   string adhoc                                                              data structures algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
