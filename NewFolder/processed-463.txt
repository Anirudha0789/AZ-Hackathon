 you are provided four points pp on xxaxis qq on yyaxis rrmin  value on xxaxis and ssmin  value on yyaxis  initially p≥rp≥r and q≥sq≥s  you can perform the following operation less than or equal to n times select either pp or qq and reduce it by   where point pp cannot become less than rr and point qq cannot become less than ss  find the minimum possible area under pqp⋅qpqp⋅q you can cover by applying the given operation less than or equal to nn times  input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   the only line of the test case contains  integer points pqrspqrs and nn   output  for each test case print one integer the minimum possible area under pp and qp⋅qqp⋅q you can cover by applying the given operation less than or equal to nn times   constraints  ≤t≤⋅≤t≤⋅ ≤pqrsn≤≤pqrsn≤ p≥rp≥r and q≥sq≥s  sample input                                           sample output                      explanation  in the first test case if you reduce pp five times then only obtain ⋅⋅  in the second test case if you reduce qq three times then only obtain ⋅⋅  in the third test case if you reduce bb one time and qq one time then only obtain ⋅⋅  in the fourth test case if you reduce q ten times then only obtain ⋅⋅    author ★arpit editorial  codechef comproblemsminarea tags                                   arpit bruteforce cplusplus graphs greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
