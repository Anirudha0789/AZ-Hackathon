 a triangle is acute if all its internal angles are acute  o  you are given a set of n points on a d plane  calculate the number of acute triangles that can be formed using points from the set as vertices   two triangles are different if the set of three vertices of one triangle is not equal to the set of three vertices of the other triangle   input the first line of the input contains an integer n the number of points in the set  each of the next n lines contains two space separated integers which are the x and y coordinates of points in the set  output output a single line containing the number of acute triangles  constraints    ≤ n ≤   the x y coordinate of each point satisfies  ≤ x y ≤    all points are distinct    example input        output   input        output   input          output   explanation example case   two acute triangles are       and        author tuanadm tester ★keshav editorial  codechef comproblemstaacute tags                                   triangles sorting binary search                                                              advanced algorithms computational geometry polygons algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
