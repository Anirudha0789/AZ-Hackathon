 read problem statements in bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  this is an interactive problem  a mysterious organisation has stolen an emp chip prototype from a hightech us facility  igi knows the consequences of the chip falling into the wrong hands  since it is just a prototype they wish to destroy it completely instead of attempting to retrieve it  the best opportunity to do so is when the chip is being transferred from one base to another in a secured truck  the truck can move on an infinite twodimensional plane  initially it is located at some point with integer coordinates hkhk  unfortunately this point and the route the truck is going to follow are unknown  to accomplish his task david jones can use two kinds of weapons with the following feedback systems  hellfire ― launched towards a single point xyxy  anything lying at this point is instantly destroyed  lets denote the location of the truck at this point in time by abab  then the feedback is one of the following strings  o if xaxa and ybyb py if xaxa and ybyb ny if xaxa and ybyb xp if xaxa and ybyb xn if xaxa and ybyb pp if xaxa and ybyb pn if xaxa and ybyb np if xaxa and ybyb nn if xaxa and ybyb ring of fire ― applied on a rectangular region with a bottom left corner xyxy and a top right corner xyxy  anything lying on the perimeter of the rectangle gets instantly destroyed  lets denote the location of the truck at this point in time by abab  then the feedback is one of the following strings  o if abab lies on the perimeter of the rectangle in if abab lies strictly inside the rectangle out if abab lies outside the rectangle  in addition if an attack is unsuccessful the truck moves exactly dd units in one of the four possible axisparallel directions i e  it moves from its current position abab to adbadb or abdabd or a−dba−db or ab−dab−d not necessarily the same direction for all unsuccessful attacks  the value of dd is fixed and known to be either  the truck does not move or   each weapon may be used multiple times and they may be used in any order  however since using the weapons is costly you may only make up to qq attacks with both types of weapons in total  obviously your task is to destroy the truck i e  to receive o as the feedback  interaction  first you should read a line containing three spaceseparated integers tt qq and dd  you should solve tt test cases each with the same parameters qq and dd  the description of interaction for tt test cases follows  for each test case you may make up to qq queries  for each query if you want to use a hellfire attack print a single line containing three spaceseparated integers  xx and yy −⋅≤xy≤⋅−⋅≤xy≤⋅  if you want to use a ring of fire attack print a single line containing five spaceseparated integers  xx yy xx and yy −⋅≤x≤x≤⋅−⋅≤x≤x≤⋅ and −⋅≤y≤y≤⋅−⋅≤y≤y≤⋅  then you should read a single line containing one string  if you ask an invalid query or exceed the query limit this string is failed and you should immediately terminate your program to receive the wrong answer verdict  otherwise this string is the feedback for your attack  as soon as you receive feedback o you should stop making queries and continue solving the remaining test cases   note some of the test files use a nonadaptive grader while some use an adaptive grader where the initial point and the route are not fixed at the start but the answers to your queries are chosen in such a way that there is always at least one initial point hkhk and sequence of moves which are consistent with all answers  dont forget to flush the output after printing each line constraints  tt hk≤hk≤ d∈d∈  subtasks subtask   points qq dd subtask   points qq dd subtask   points qq dd subtask   points qq dd example you         grader

the interaction  the truck is initially located at   the first attack is hellfire at the point   the attack is unsuccessful and the feedback is nn  the truck moves to the point   the second attack is hellfire at the point   the attack is unsuccessful and the feedback is xp  the truck moves to the point   the third attack is ring of fire at the perimeter of the rectangle with the bottom left corner  and the top right corner   since the truck lies inside this rectangle the attack is unsuccessful and the feedback is in  the truck moves to the point   the fourth attack is hellfire at the point   the attack is unsuccessful and the feedback is pn  the truck moves to the point   the fifth attack is hellfire at the point −−  the attack is unsuccessful and the feedback is ny  the truck moves to the point   the sixth attack is ring of fire at the perimeter of the rectangle with the bottom left corner −− and the top right corner   since the truck lies on this perimeter the attack is successful and the feedback is o since the truck with the emp chip is destroyed    author ★jay editorial  codechef comproblemschaosemp tags                                   interactive problems geometry binary
