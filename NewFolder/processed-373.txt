 read problems statements in mandarin chinese  russian and vietnamese as well  the median of a sequence is the element in the middle of the sequence after it is sorted  for a sequence with even size the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sequence after sorting  for example for a sequence aa the median is equal to  and for aa the median is equal to     fulu is a famous programmer in his country  he wrote the following program given in pseudocode for finding the median in a sequence aa with length nn readn reada a     an sorta  simultaneously remove elements ak and an mod k from the array a  the order of the remaining n elements is unchanged removeak an mod k return an  integer division  the program takes an integer kk as a parameter  fulu can choose this integer arbitrarily between  and n−n− inclusive  little lima fulus friend thinks fulus program is wrong as always  as finding one counterexample would be an easy task for lima he has already found the sequence aa which is a counterexample for any k≤k≤ lima decided to make hacking more interesting  fulu should give him four parameters skmmskmm in addition to nn and lima should find the lexicographically smallest proper sequence aa with length nn as a counterexample  we say that a sequence aa with length nn indexed is proper if it satisfies the following conditions  it contains only positive integers aaa⋯an−saaa⋯an−s m≤ai≤mm≤ai≤m for each ≤in≤in the number returned by fulus program ran with the given parameter kk is different from the correct median of the sequence aa  can you help lima find the lexicographically smallest counterexample or determine that fulus program works perfectly for the given parameters input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first and only line of each test case contains five spaceseparated integers nn ss kk mm and mm   output for each test case if there is no proper sequence print a single line containing the integer −− otherwise print a single line containing nn spaceseparated integers — the lexicographically smallest proper sequence  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤n−≤k≤n− ≤s≤≤s≤ ≤m≤m≤s≤m≤m≤s                         sample input                                                                sample output                                explanation example case  for the sequence aa it is already sorted so the program would just remove the first two elements kk nknk and return the only remaining element   obviously the median of the original sequence is   it can be shown that there is no lexicographically smaller proper sequence  example case  the only possible sequence is aa which is not proper since fulus program will give the correct answer  for it   author ★allllekssssa editorial  codechef comproblemshackfu tags                                   greedy constructive                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
