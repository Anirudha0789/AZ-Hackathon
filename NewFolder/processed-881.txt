 “it is our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities ” harry potter was sitting in library staring at newly found tom riddles secret diary  out of curiosity he started asking questions about the past of chambers of secrets  tom took him to the year of   there harry saw dumbledore and mcgonagall arranging the students to stop hagrid from opening chamber of secrets  to stop hagrid the students need to be arranged in particular order of their heights  suppose there are nn students each with height hihi standing in line  the order of the students must be as follows    if the number of students is less than  it is always possible to      arrange students    hihi    hi−hi−    gcd hi−hi−  hi−hi− for all ii where gcdx y is greatest common factor of x and y     dumbledore asks the then prefect tom riddle to arrange the students in the following order  furthermore hagrid being a halfgiant the arrangement of the height of students must be lexicographically  greatest  though we know it wasnt hagrid who opened the chamber of secrets but still you need to help tom and dumbledore to arrange the students  notenote consider gcdx  x where x is a nonnegative integer  input  the first line will contain tt number of test cases  then the test cases follow   the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn in the next line nn numbers  follow denoting the height of the students whom you have to arrange    output for each test case print a single line containing nn numbers separated by space which denotes the height of the students and follows the conditions given or −− if the students cannot be arranged following the given condition    constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤∗≤n≤∗ ≤ai≤≤ai≤  sum of nn over all test cases is less than ∗∗   sample input              sample output        author ★vikasnitd editorial  codechef comproblemsalora tags                                   recursion sorting vikasnitd                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
