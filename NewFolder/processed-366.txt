 after solving some number theory related problems kbg challenged vd to solve following problem  you are given an array aa consisting of nn positive integers and qq queries  each query is of the form  ll rr given two integers ll and rr ≤lr≤n≤lr≤n let bb denote the subarray alralr  find the maximum possible gcd of any subsequence of bb which has length greater than    for each query find the maximum possible gcdgcd of any subsequence in the given range having length greater than   input format  first line contains tt number of test cases  description of the test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a two spaceseparated integer nn and qq  length of the array and number of queries respectively  the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers aa   anaa   an  next qq lines of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers ll and rr   output format for each test case print qq lines  the ithith line contains one integer  the answer for the ithith query  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  ≤q≤≤q≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ ≤lr≤n≤lr≤n sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   sum of qq over all test cases does not exceed    subtasks  subtask   points ≤n≤≤n≤  ≤q≤≤q≤  ≤t≤≤t≤ subtask   points ≤n≤≤n≤  ≤q≤≤q≤  sum of nn and qq over all test cases does not exceed   subtask   points ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤q≤≤q≤  sum of nn and qq over all test cases does not exceed  and  respectively   subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                  sample output                              explanation test case  given aa and  queries   in the first query ll and rr  thus the subarray bb  one of the subsequences of bb having maximum gcd and length greater than  is   the gcd of this subsequence is gcdgcd  it can be proven that no other subsequence of bb having length greater than  has a gcd greater than   in the second query ll and rr  thus the subarray bb  one of the subsequences of bb having maximum gcd and length greater than  is   the gcd of this subsequence is gcdgcd  it can be proven that no other subsequence of bb having length greater than  has a gcd greater than     author ★kbg tester ★mexomerf editorial  codechef comproblemsmathology tags                                   data structures segment trees number theory                                                              advanced data structures advanced tree structures mathematics                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
