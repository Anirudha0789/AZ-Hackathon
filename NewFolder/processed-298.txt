 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese russian vietnamese and bengali as well  in a redblue tree each vertex is either red or blue and adjacent vertices always have different colours  you are given a tree with nn vertices numbered  through nn  it is not necessarily a redblue tree but its vertices are still coloured red and blue  you may perform the following operation any number of times including zero choose two adjacent vertices and swap their colours  find the smallest number of operations required to transform the tree into a redblue tree or determine that it is impossible  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  n−n− lines follow  each of these lines contains two spaceseparated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge  the last line contains a string ss with length nn  for each valid ii the iith character of this string is either  if the iith vertex is initially red or  if it is initially blue   output print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest number of operations or −− if it is impossible to transform the tree into a redblue tree  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤  ≤n≤≤n≤  ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n  ss contains only characters  and  the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed                          sample input                                                                                    sample output                             explanation example case  we can perform the following operations  swap the colours of vertices  and  the string of colours becomes   swap the colours of vertices  and  the string of colours becomes   swap the colours of vertices  and  the string of colours becomes  so the tree is a redblue tree    author ★pandeyji editorial  codechef comproblemsrbtrees tags                                   dfs bfs bipartite                                                              algorithms graph algos traversals coloring                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
