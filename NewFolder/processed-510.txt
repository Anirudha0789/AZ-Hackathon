 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese vietnamese and bengali as well  you are given a grid with nn rows and mm columns where each cell contains either  or   you may perform the following operation up to kk times choose two different cells and swap the values in them  find the largest possible side length of a square subgrid which contains only s after performing these operations  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt total number of testcases  each testcase contains nn lines of input  the first line contains three spaceseparated integers nn mm and kk  nn lines follow  for each valid ii the iith of these lines contains a single string with length mm describing the iith row of the grid   output for each testcase print a single line containing one integer ― the largest side length of a square subgrid containing only s  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nm≤≤nm≤ ≤k≤n∗m≤k≤n∗m sum of n∗mn∗m over all tests is atmost ∗∗ each string contains only characters  and   example input                       example output     explanation case  since all the s in the grid already form a square with side length  no swaps are required  case  if we could swap the values in pairs of cells   and   we would get a square with side length  using  swaps  but since the maximum possible number of swaps is  the answer cannot be greater than   case  we can swap the values in pairs of cells   and    then we get a square with side length  using  swaps   author daanishadm editorial  codechef comproblemshollow tags                                   binary search prefix sum                                                              algorithms searching simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
