 you are given a graph with nn vertices numbered  to nn and mm bidirectional edges which doesnt contain multiple edges or selfloops — that is the given graph is a simple undirected graph  for each pair of vertices abab such that ≤ab≤n≤ab≤n it is possible to add a new edge between vertices aa and bb to the graph with a cost of a−ba−b  find the minimum cost of adding edges so that vertex nn is reachable from vertex   input format  the first line of input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains  spaceseparated integers nn and mm  the ithith of the next mm lines contains  spaceseparated integers uiui and vivi denoting a bidirectional edge between vertex uiui and vertex vivi in the graph   output format for each test case output the answer in a single line  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ ≤m≤⋅≤m≤⋅ ≤uivi≤n≤uivi≤n the graph doesnt contain selfloops or multiple edges sum of nn over all testcases is no more than ⋅⋅  sum of mm over all testcases is no more than ⋅⋅                          sample input                                                                          sample output                               explanation test case  add an edge between vertices  and  with cost −−  test case  vertices  and  are already connected so no edges need to be added   author ★visheshs editorial  codechef comproblemstravelling tags                                   easy graphs shortestpath start visheshs                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
