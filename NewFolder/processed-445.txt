 read problem statements in bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given a string aa of length nn consisting of zeroes and ones  you want to partition it into blocks consisting of consecutive indices such that each block has an odd sum and has length at most mm  for each mm from  to nn find the minimum number of blocks required or report that it is impossible  input  the first line contains an integer tt the number of test cases  each test case contains two lines the first line of each test case contains an integer nn  the second line of each test case contains a string aaa…anaaa…an    output for each test case print nn spaceseparated integers  the mmth of these integers should be the minimum number of blocks of length at most mm the array can be partitioned into such that each block has an odd sum or −− if it is impossible to do so  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ the sum of nn over all test cases doesnt exceed    subtasks  subtask   points the sum of nn over all test cases doesnt exceed   subtask   points the sum of nn over all test cases doesnt exceed   subtask   points the sum of nn over all test cases doesnt exceed   subtask   points the sum of nn over all test cases doesnt exceed   subtask   points the sum of nn over all test cases doesnt exceed   subtask   points no additional constraints                          sample input                                                        sample output                                 explanation clearly if mm no such partitioning is possible as the first block must consist of a single   for mm we can partition it as   note that  is also a valid partition  if mm the partition consisting of a single block  is valid as the total sum  is odd   author ★umnik editorial  codechef comproblemspartodd tags                                   dynamic programming greedy observation prefix sum                                                              algorithms simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
