  read problems statements in russian here lucy had recently learned the game called natural numbers  the rules of the game are really simple  there are n players  at the same time every player says one natural number  lets call the number said by the ith player ai  the person with the smallest unique number that is the smallest number that was not said by anybody else wins  sometimes there is a case when there are no unique numbers at all  then the game is obviously a draw so nobody wins it  sometimes its hard to determine the winner especially when the number of players is enormous  so in this problem your assignment will be given the names of the players and the numbers every of them have said  please tell the name of the winner or determine that nobody wins  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of every test case consists of a single integer n  the number of players  then n lines will follow  each of these n lines will consist of the players name and the number ai said by her separated by a single space  output for each test case output a single line containing an answer to the corresponding test case  the name of the winner or a string nobody wins  if nobody wins the game  scoring subtask   points t     n     ai    subtask   points t     n     ai   subtask   points t     n    ai   subtask   points t     n     ai   you can safely assume that in all the test cases the length of any name will not exceed five letters  all the players  names  are unique                                                                                                                                 sample input                              kouta  yuka  mayu  lucy  nana   lucy  nana                           sample output                            lucy nobody wins   author sergeyadm tester â˜…rubanenko editorial  codechef comproblemsnumbers tags                                   sorting simple algos                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
