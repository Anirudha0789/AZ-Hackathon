 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given a string ss with length nn and you should change it to a palindrome using a sequence of zero or more operations  in one operation you should choose two adjacent elements of ss two characters and swap them however neither of these elements may be used in any other operation  find the minimum number of operations you have to perform in order to change the string ss into a palindrome or determine that it is impossible  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the second line contains a single string ss with length nn   output for each test case  if it is impossible to make the string ss a palindrome print a single line containing the string no without quotes  otherwise print two lines  the first of these lines should contain the string yes without quotes  the second line should contain a single integer ― the minimum required number of operations   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ss contains only lowercase english letters the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   subtasks subtask   points  n≤n≤ ss contains only characters a and b the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                              abab  acbba  aaaab                          sample output                            yes  yes  no  author admin editorial  codechef comproblemsswappali tags                                   string                                                              data structures                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
