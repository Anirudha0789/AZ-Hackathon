 xa  fluffy the squirrel is playing a game with flippy the bird  flippy the bird thinks of an array of integers a  after that he constructs a d array of integers b such that bi j  ai or aj for all i j  you may learn about the or bitwise operator here   wikipedia orgwikibitwiseoperation  however to make the game more challenging flippy doesnt given fluffy the entire array b  instead he leave some of the elements blank and give the remaining entries to fluffy  fluffys job is to determine a possible array a that matches the information flippy gives him  i e  the entries that were given to him can be obtained by the array a can you help him  xa input  the first line contains a single integer n the number of elements in the array  the next n lines contains n integers each denoting the value of bi j  if the value is  it means that flippy did not give the value of bi j to fluffy   xa output output n spaceseperated integers an array a denoting a possible array that matches the given matrix  it is guaranteed that a solution exists  if there are multiple solutions you may output any of them  xa constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ bi j ≤     subtasks  subtask   points   ≤ n ≤   ≤ bi j ≤  subtask   points   ≤ bi j ≤  subtask   points  original constraints  xa example input            output    xa explanation example case  it can be easily checked that this is one of the possible solutions  note that    is also a possible solution    author ★zscoder editorial  codechef comproblemsmco tags                                   greedy zscoder                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java cpp pyth pyp  submit
