 laxman is doing diwali shopping  there are n shops numbered from  to n  laxman wants to buy m different types of crackers  crackers are numbered from  to m  each shop sells many types of crackers  laxman is currently at the ith shop  laxman want to find j and k such that j  i and k  i and he can buy all m types of crackers only by visiting shops in the range of j to k  if there are multiple valid j k he then want to minimize the window size that is minimize the value of k  j  if there are still multiple valid j k then he wants to minimize the value of j  it is also known that by visiting all the n shops laxman can surely buy all m types of crackers  write a program to output j k values for all valid i  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  each test case is described as follows first line of each test case has  integers n and m  following n lines describe the shops  each of the n lines starts with an integer x which denotes the number of different types of crackers sold in that shop  x integers follow describing the cracker types  all the x integers are different  output for each test case output n lines one for each i   i  n  each line should contain two integers j and k  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ m ≤   ≤ x ≤   ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤   ≤ sum of m over all test cases ≤   ≤ sum of x over all test cases ≤   example input                    output             explanation test case  laxman needs to visit all  shops to but all m types  test case  laxman needs to visit shops   to get all m types  or he can visit shops   to get all m types  for i   we could have bought all types from shops   but we prefer   because    as stated in the statement we want to minimize j in case of tie    author admin editorial  codechef comproblemsacmkg tags                                   acmkgr admin easymedium sorting twopointers                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages java c cpp pyp  submit
