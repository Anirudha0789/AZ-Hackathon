 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  there are nn integers in an array aa   two players take turns alternatively in placing signs  or  before them and then they all are added  the sign can be placed before any element of the array that has not been assigned a sign yet  all elements must be assigned a sign  player  wins if the resulting sum is even else player  wins  find out who shall win if they both play optimally   input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   each testcase contains  lines of input   first line contains a single integer nn size of the array  second line contains nn space separated integers   aa…anaa…an denoting the array elements   output for each testcase output in a single line  if the first person wins or  if the second person wins  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤  subtasks subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                 sample output                               explanation case  lets consider all possible choices to prove that person  always has a winning chance regardless of what person  does   suppose person  adds a positive sign to  person  can also add a positive sign to  to get total of  which is odd    suppose person  adds a negative sign to  person  can add a positive sign to  to get total of  which is odd −−  suppose person  adds a positive sign to  person  can also add a positive sign to  to get total of  which is odd    suppose person  adds a negative sign to  person  can add a positive sign to  to get total of −− which is odd −−−−  author ★akashbhalotia editorial  codechef comproblemsevengame tags                                   arithmetic                                                              mathematics basic maths                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
