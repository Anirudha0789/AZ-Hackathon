 chef is playing an easier variation of the board game ‘risk’ with his friend mike  there is an n∗mn∗m grid depicting the world map  each cell of the grid is either  or  where  denotes that there is land on this cell while  denotes water   in a turn a player can capture an uncaptured cell that has land and keep capturing neighbouring cells that share a side with it if they are on land  a cell once captured by a player cant be captured again by another player  the game continues till no uncaptured cell has land  each player wants to be in control of as many cells of land as possible in total when the game finishes  find the maximum number of cells of land that chef can capture if he plays second and both players play optimally   input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow  each testcase contains nn lines of input  first line will contain  space separated integers nn and mm denoting the size of the grid   each of the next nn lines contains a binary string of length mm depicting the map    output for each testcase output in a single line answer to the problem  constraints  ≤nm≤≤nm≤ each character in the grid is either  or  theres atleast  land on the grid sum of n∗mn∗m over all testcases is almost                           sample input                                                                     sample output                               explanation in test case  if both players play optimally it takes  steps to finish the game step  first mike chooses the cells  adding  to his score  step  second chef chooses the cell  adding  to his score  step  next mike chooses the cell  adding  to his score  step  next chef chooses the cell  adding  to his score  step  finally mike chooses the cell  adding  to his score  hence total score of chef is    author daanishadm editorial  codechef comproblemsrisk tags                                   greedy bfs sorting                                                              algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
