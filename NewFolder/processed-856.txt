 xa find the fastest way to type a word given the word  you can skip total of t letters  time needed to write a letter is given in an array with  integers depicting the time needed to type the alphabets  index  will represent a  will represent b  will represent c till  representing z  print the fastest time needed to write the word after skipping t letters  note each letter must be treated distinctly example if word is aaa and you can skip  letter then you should type aa and not skip all the as  input input description  input will start will an integer n on newline representing the count of test case  each case will contain a number t on a newline representing total count of letters you can skip  next line of each test case will contain  integers representing the array of time needed to write letters a to z  next line of each test case will contain the word that you need to type  xa output for each test case print the desired outputs each on a newline  xa constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ time needed for each letter ≤   ≤ length of word ≤   ≤ t ≤ length of given  word  xa example input                             abac output  xa explanation example case   one a can be skipped requiring time  to write the word   author ★chandubaba editorial  codechef comproblemsketfast tags                                   chandubaba keteki kqpm sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
