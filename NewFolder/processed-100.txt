 given a string of length nn consisting of lowercase alphabets and a pivot index pp based index  substring from pthpth character till end is immutable while the following operations can be done on substring on the left of the pthpth index   insert a character   delete a character   rearrange the characters   cost of insertion and deletion is  while rearranging characters has no cost  using above operations you need to form new string which will be palindrome about pthpth character or pthpth and pthpth characters of the original string  what is the minimum cost of operations for above task  input first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow  each testcase contains of a single line of input a string and pp space seperated    output for each testcase output in a single line answer i e  minimum cost of operations   constraints ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤p≤n≤p≤n  subtasks subtask   points original constraints  sample input  bacb   sample output   explanation insert c on just left to a  new string will be bcacb which is palindrome  cost   author pecchapter editorial  codechef comproblemsmpal tags                                   array easy map observation pecchapter                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
