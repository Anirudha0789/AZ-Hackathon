 the chef has recently learned a new recipe to make pizza  basically chef has nn ingredients and each ingredient ii has a cost cici  a topping for the pizza is prepared by taking at least mm ingredients and the cost of making a topping is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum cost of the ingredient involved in making this topping  each ingredient must be present in exactly one topping and also it is not allowed to leave any ingredient    let the number of toppings prepared by the chef be xx ≤x≤x following the above constraint and the cost of toppings be denoted by ttt    txttt    tx  the overall cost of the pizza is defined as the maximum of the cost of all such toppings i e maxttt    txmaxttt    tx  help the chef to find the minimum cost in which the pizza can be prepared i e  you need to minimize maxttt    txmaxttt    tx  note you need to minimize the overall cost of the pizza you dont need to maximize or minimize the cost of any topping or the number of toppings  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line contains two integers nn and mm denoting the number of ingredients and the minimum size of the group of ingredients for preparing a topping  the second line contains n space separated ccc   cnccc   cn integers denoting the cost of each ingredient  output for each test case print a single integer denoting the minimum cost to prepare the pizza  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤m≤n≤≤m≤n≤ ≤ci≤≤ci≤ sum of n over all the test cases does not exceed ∗∗  sample input                  sample output    explanation in the first test case we have to take the whole array so difference between the maximum and minimum is       in the second test case we can partition our array into  and  so the overall cost is max     author ★naveen editorial  codechef comproblemsrecipee tags                                   binarysearch dynamicprogramming naveen                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
