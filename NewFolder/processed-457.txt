 xa fluffy the squirrel is playing with strings today  today he is given a string s consisting of lowercase letters  every second he can shift a letter to the left or right  for example if the current letter is c then he can change it to b or d in one second  note that if we shift z to the right it becomes a and similarly a becomes z when shifted to the left   now fluffy has k seconds to spare and he would like to shift the letters of the string such that it becomes a palindrome  a palindrome is a string that reads the same from the left and from the right  for instance aibohphobia lol x eye and racecar are all examples of palindromes  in addition among all the palindromes he can create he wants the lexicographically smallest such palindrome  a string s is smaller than a string t of the same length if for the smallest i such that si  ti we have si  ti  in informal terms this means that s appears before t if they are placed in a dictionary  for example azz is lexicographically smaller than baa   find the lexicographically smallest string fluffy can achieve within k seconds  note that he may choose not to move at any point xa input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  for each test case there will be two lines  the first line contains k the number of seconds fluffy can spend  the next line contains a string s denoting the string fluffy was given  output for each test case output a single line containing the lexicographically smallest palindrome t that can be obtained by fluffy in k seconds  if it is impossible to obtain such a palindrome output  on the line instead  constraints   ≤ t ≤  length of s does not exceed   ≤ k ≤   subtasks  subtask   points  length of s does not exceed  subtask   points  s is guaranteed to be a palindrome subtask   points  original constraints  example input   ez  abcdef  output aa   xa explanation example case   we can shift the letter e left  times and the letter z right  time  this takes  seconds which is not more than the given  seconds and clearly aa is the lexicographically smallest palindrome fluffy can get   example case   it is impossible to transform the string into a palindrome in  seconds    author ★zscoder editorial  codechef comproblemsmco tags                                   easy greedy zscoder                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java cpp pyth pyp  submit
