  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  during the indian programming camp ipc there are n trainers  the camp runs for d days  each day there can be at most one lecture  the ith trainer arrives on day di and then stays till the end of the camp  he also wants to teach exactly ti lectures  for each lecture that a trainer was not able to teach he will feel sad and his sadness level will be increased by si  you are the main organizer of the contest  you want to find minimum total sadness of the trainers  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of testcases  for each test case the first line contains two space separated integers n d  the ith of the next n lines will contain three space separated integers di ti si respectively  output for each test case output a single integer corresponding to the minimum total sadness of the trainers achievable  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n d ≤   ≤  di  ti ≤ d  ≤  si ≤   subtasks subtask   points   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n d ≤   ≤  di  ti ≤ d  ≤  si ≤  subtask   points  original constraints                         sample input                                                                              sample output                               explanation example case   both the first and second trainer want to take exactly two lectures  the first trainer arrives on the st day and the second trainer arrives on the nd day  consider a schedule where the first trainer takes the first two lectures and the second trainer takes the last lecture on the day   this way the second trainer will take only one lecture but wanted to take two  thus his sadness will be   the first trainer took all the lectures that he wanted to take ie  two lectures  thus the total sadness is       you can check that no other way of assigning trainers to the days will give a better answer than this  example case   in this case the trainers can all take all their ideal number of lectures  example case   in this case the first trainer arrives on day  and wants to take two lectures  this is not possible as he can take at most one lecture on day  and the camp ends on day   the second trainer wants to take only one lecture which he can take on any one of the st or nd days  you can see that in one of the first or second days no lecture will be held   author admin editorial  codechef comproblemsipctrain tags                                   heaps multiset implementation                                                              data structures sets algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
