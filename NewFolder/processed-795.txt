 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  there is a castle which can be described as an undirected tree with nn vertices and n−n− edges  each edge has a magic number cc  when a group of tourists visit the castle they are interested in a path between vertices uu and vv  they think that an edge is interesting if its magic number is ≤k≤k  the total attractiveness of the path is the xor of all interesting edges on it  given mm groups of tourists find the total attractiveness of the path for each group  input  the first line contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  then t test case descriptions follow   the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn denoting the number of vertices  the next n−n− lines each contain three integers uu vv and cc which denote an edge between vertices uu and vv with magical number cc  the next line contains a single integer mm which denotes the number of requests  the next mm lines contain information about the requests  each line contains three integers uu vv and kk   output for each request output a single integer in a separate line  the total attractiveness of the path  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nm≤≤nm≤ ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n ≤ck≤≤ck≤  subtasks   subtask   points ≤nm≤≤nm≤ subtask   points ≤nm≤≤nm≤ subtask   points ≤nm≤≤nm≤                         sample input                                                                                       sample output                                   author ★fekete editorial  codechef comproblemspshttr tags                                   trees segment trees fenwick trees lowest common ancestor dfs order sorting                                                              data structures graphs advanced data structures advanced tree structures algorithms graph algos traversals dfs                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
