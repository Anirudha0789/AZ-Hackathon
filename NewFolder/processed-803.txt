 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef is playing a game with his brother chefu  before the game begins c cards are placed on a table  each card has a number written on it since c can be very large these numbers are described by two sequences a and d  each of these sequences has length n for each i  ≤ i ≤ n di cards each with number ai written on it are placed on the table  therefore c is equal to the sum of elements of d  note that the elements of a dont have to be unique  you are also given a sequence b with length k  the game will last for exactly k rounds numbered  through k  the players alternate turns — chef plays on oddnumbered turns and his brother on evennumbered turns  in the ith round the current player must select bi cards currently lying on the table keep these cards on the table and discard all other cards  chefs goal is to maximize the sum of numbers written on cards that remain on the table after the last round while chefus goal is minimize this sum  what will be the sum of numbers written on cards remaining on the table if both players play optimally input  the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers n and k  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an  the third line contains n spaceseparated integers d d     dn  the fourth line contains k spaceseparated integers b b     bk   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the sum of numbers on cards that remain on the table at the end of the game  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n k ≤   ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤   ≤ sum of k over all test cases ≤   ≤ ai di ≤  for each valid i  ≤ bi ≤ c for each valid i bi  bi for each valid i  subtasks  subtask   points  di   for each valid i sum of n over all test cases ≤  sum of k over all test cases ≤   subtask   points original constraints                         sample input                                                                  sample output                             explanation example case  the cards that are on table initially are         chef in his turn should select  cards to keep and discard the rest so he will keep        after that chefu should keep  cards and discard the rest so he will keep     after that the game ends and sum of cards remained on the table is         author ★kingofnumbers tester ★mgch editorial  codechef comproblemsgamenumb tags                                   prefix sum suffix sum                                                              algorithms simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
