 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  a battle is going to begin in the kingdom of airland  there are nn soldiers in the kingdom numbered  through nn and standing in a circle in such a way that for each valid ii the soldier directly to the right of the iith soldier is soldier ii and the soldier directly to the right of the nnth soldier is soldier   each soldier holds a sword and a shield  the sword is used to attack other soldiers and the shield is used to defend from attacks  lets denote the attack value of the iith soldiers sword by aiai and the defense value of the iith soldiers shield by didi  in the battle each soldier picks one of the soldiers standing to his left and right and attacks that soldier  the choices of the soldiers are completely independent so each soldier can be attacked by the soldier to his left by the soldier to his right the power of such an attack is the attack value of the attacking soldiers sword by both of them then the power of the resulting attack is the sum of the attack values of these soldiers swords or by nobody  a soldier remains alive if the defense value of his shield is strictly greater than the power with which he is attacked  everyone attacks simultaneously and there is only one round of attacks  each soldier that remains alive at the end is awarded a laurel  the king of airland likes these fights so the host of the battle promised the king that he can pick one soldier and if the soldier he picks survives the battle the king receives the shield of that soldier  chef is the deputy of the king and you want to help him pick a soldier for the king in such a way that the king receives the best shield with the greatest defense value  however if chef picks a soldier and that soldier does not survive chef will be thrown in a snake pit  therefore it should be guaranteed that the chosen soldier will survive regardless of the decisions of the other soldiers  can you help chef make the best choice and tell him the defense value of the shield which the king gets or decide that he can be thrown in the snake pit no matter which soldier he picks input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an  the third line contains nn spaceseparated integers dd…dndd…dn   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the best defense value of the shield the king gets or −− if chef can be thrown in the snake pit  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤aidi≤≤aidi≤ for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                              sample output                              explanation example case  soldier  can be attacked by soldier  andor soldier   if only soldier  attacks him the power of the attack is   if only soldier  attacks him the power of the attack is  again  if they attack together the power of the attack is   in each of these cases soldier  will live  soldier  can be attacked by soldier  with attack power   his shield has defense value  which is not enough so in this case soldier  would die  the best safe choice is soldier  with defense value   example case  no soldier is guaranteed to survive the battle so the answer is −−   author ★stelkasouridis editorial  codechef comproblemsdepchef tags                                   observation                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
