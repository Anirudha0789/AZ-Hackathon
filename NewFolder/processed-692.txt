  read problems statements in mandarin chinese and russian as well   tthe following graph g is called a petersen graph and its vertices have been numbered from  to   some letters have also been assigned to vertices of g as can be seen from the following picture   tlets consider a walk w in graph g which consists of l vertices w w     wl such that wi is connected with wi   for  ≤ i  l  a string s of l letters ae is realized by walk w if the sequence of letters written along w is equal to s  vertices can be visited multiple times while walking along w   for example s  abbeccd is realized by w          your task is to determine whether there is a walk w which realizes a given string s in graph g and if so find the lexicographically least such walk  input  tthe first line of the input contains one integer t denoting the number of testcases to process  tthe only line of each testcase contains one string s  it is guaranteed that s only consists of symbols ae   output  tthe output should contain exactly t lines one line per each testcase in the order of their appearance  for each testcase if there is no walk w which realizes s then output   otherwise you should output the least lexicographical walk w which realizes s  since all of the vertices are numbered from  to  then it can be encoded as a string consisting of symbols  see the examples section for more details   constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ s ≤                            sample input                             aab aabe                          sample output                               author ★kostyaby editorial  codechef comproblemspetersen tags                                   dfs bfs observation                                                              algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
