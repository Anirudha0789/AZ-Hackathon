 read problem statements in bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  its a lockdown  you’re bored in your house and are playing golf in the hallway   the hallway has nn tiles numbered from  to nn from left to right  there is a hole on tile number xx  you hit the ball standing on tile   when you hit the ball it bounces at lengths of kk i e  the tiles covered by it are kk…kk… and so on until the ball passes tile nn  if the ball doesnt enter the hole in the first trial you try again but this time standing on the tile nn  when you hit the ball it bounces at lengths of kk i e  the tiles covered by it are nn−kn−k…nn−kn−k… and so on until the ball passes tile    find if the ball will enter the hole either in its forward journey or backward journey  note the input and output of this problem are large so prefer using fast inputoutput methods  input  the first line contains an integer tt the number of test cases  then the test cases follow   the only line of each test case contains three integers nxknxk    output output in a single line the answer which should be yes if the ball enters the hole either in the forward or backward journey and no if not  you may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase for example the strings yes yes yes and yes will all be treated as identical  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤xk≤n≤≤xk≤n≤  subtasks subtask   points n≤n≤ subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                               sample output                            yes no no explanation in each test case the tiles covered by the ball for nn and kk are  in the forward journey and  in the backward journey  therefore the answer for the first test case is yes since the ball falls in the position of the hole at tile   but the answer for test cases  and  is no since the ball does not fall in the position of the hole   author daanishadm editorial  codechef comproblemslkdngolf tags                                   basic maths                                                              mathematics                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
