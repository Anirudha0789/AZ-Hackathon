  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef spent n days working really hard he planned loads of tasks as many as ai tasks to do on the ith day chefs work was brutal so he only managed to finish bi tasks on the ith day  the good news is that chef has a time machine  the time machine has k white buttons and m black buttons  each button has a positive integer printed on it  now chef goes through all n days consequently and presses buttons  each day chef can only press one button either white or black  after using a button once it becomes inactive  pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x  note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x  pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x  note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it number of completed tasks dont exceed the number of tasks  chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after n days using the machine in the best way be careful time is sensitive chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned as this may result in a moreworkthanplanned paradox killing all lazy people on the planet input  the first line of input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains three integers — n k m — denoting the number of days white and black buttons appropriately  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a …  an denoting the number of planned tasks  the third line contains n spaceseparated integers b b …  bn denoting the number of completed tasks  the fourth line contains k spaceseparated integers c c …  ck denoting the integers on white buttons  the fifth and last line contains m spaceseparated integers d d …  dm denoting the integers on black buttons   output  in a single line output an integer — the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n k m ≤   ≤ bi ≤ ai  ≤   ≤ ci di  ≤   subtasks  subtask n ≤  k m ≤   points   subtask original constraints  points                           sample input                                                                      sample output                             explanation example case   in this example chef goes through the following steps use black button  on the first day  use black button  on the second day  use white button  on the third day  the arrays a and b are now effectively changed to         so he will have  uncompleted tasks   author berezin tester ★antoniuk editorial  codechef comproblemscheftma tags                                   d arrays multiset greedy                                                              data structures arrays sets algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
