 read problems statements in mandarin chinese and vietnamese as well  sereja is stuck with a problem and asks for your help  you readily agree to help sereja and he poses the following problem to you   sereja has a matrix  a of size n x n  each cell in row i and column j contains a number aij  every element of the matrix can either be  or   initially all the elements are zero   sereja informs you that he only likes the functions of the form  here the division is integer division i e  xy means integer division of x by y   sereja can choose a set of integers a a b b c c d and two other integers l r and applies the function f to the matrix as follows  he will substitute  in the every cell i j where l ≤ i ≤ r and j  fi  sereja gives you a matrix a after applying a certain number of functions to it  he asks you to find the minimal amount of functions such that after applying them sereja will get the matrix a  you need not create the matrix a exactly you are allowed to have at most  distinct cells in the matrix obtained after your operations and the matrix a  your task is to minimize the number of such functions applied  input  the first line of input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  first line of each test case contains an integer n  each of the next n lines contains n digits zero or one without spaces denoting the matrix a  output for each test case in first line output an integer corresponding to the number of functions q  next q lines should contain information about functions  each lines should contain set of integers a a b b c c d l r   the following constraints must be satisfied for the output    ≤ q ≤ nn n ≤ a b c d ≤ n  ≤ a b c ≤ n  ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   tests generation there will be  official tests  during contest you will be able to get your score on first  tests  after contest there will be rejudge on full tests set    in every test t is equal to  and n is chosen randomly in the range    further for each test case integer k is chosen   for first  tests k is chosen randomly in range   for next  tests k is chosen randomly in range   for next  tests k is chosen randomly in range   for next  tests k is chosen randomly in range    after k is chosen we generate k functions in next way  with probability  a  b   with probability  a   for all other numbers the way of generation is hidden scoring you will receive a wa if the operation doesnt satisfy the output constraints specified in the statement or the number of distinct cells in the final matrix after applying all the operations exceeds    lets s denote the sum of q  n  n    ones where ones is number of digit  in given matrix for all the test cases  your score will be to s which you should try to minimize   example input         output                      author serejaadm editorial  codechef comproblemsseafunc tags                                   challenge greedy math sept serejaadm                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
