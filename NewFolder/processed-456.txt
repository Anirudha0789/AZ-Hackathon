 you are given a grid with  rows and nn columns containing distinct integers  the number in the iith row and jjth column is denoted by aijaij  in one operation you can swap numbers in any two cells which share a side  for a binary string ss of length nn lets define fsfs as follows  fsfs is the smallest number of swaps required to achieve a state of board in which aiaiaiai if sisi and aiaiaiai if sisi for each ii from  to nn   its easy to show that its possible to achieve any state of the board by swapping adjacent elements so fsfs is always defined  find the sum of fsfs over all nn binary strings ss of length nn  input format  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt the number of test cases  the description of the test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  then two lines follow the iith line contains nn spaceseparated integers aiai…ainaiai…ain   output format for each test case output a single integer — the sum of fsfs over all binary strings ss of length nn   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤aij≤⋅n≤aij≤⋅n all aijaij are distinct  the sum of nn over all test cases doesnt exceed                           sample input                                                                                 sample output                               explanation test case  the minimum numbers of operations are  for ss   for ss     for     for  so the sum of answers is ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅   author trygubadm editorial  codechef comproblemscomprblegrid tags                                   cook dynamicprogramming greedy swapping trygubadm                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
