  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  this is an interactive problem  it means that every time you output something you must finish with a newline character and flush the output  for example in c use the fflushstdout function in java — call system out flush in python — sys stdout flush and in pascal — flushoutput  only after flushing the output will you be able to read from the input again  limak is a little bear  he has made a drawing of his house for you to get it you must first play a game with him little bears love playing games  the drawing shows a building with a roof on the top  the building is represented by a square and the roof by an isosceles triangle in the coordinate system  formally the following conditions are guaranteed  both the square and the triangle are nondegenerate i e their areas are positive and not zero  the bottom side of the triangle is its base  the bottom side of the square lies on the xaxis while the top side is a part of the base of the triangle  the base of the triangle is longer that the side of the square  the whole drawing is symmetric with respect to the yaxis  all vertices of the square and the triangle have integer coordinates and their absolute values do not exceed   all ycoordinates are nonnegative  an example of a valid drawing  your task is to find the total area of the house the sum of areas of the square and the triangle  to achieve that you are allowed to ask at most  queries  in each query you choose some point with integer coordinates and the system will tell you if this point is in the house including its boundary   interaction at most  times you can ask a query by printing  x y without the quotes in a singe line  coordinates x and y should be integers such that  ≤ x ≤  and  ≤ y ≤   after flushing the output you should read a response that is a string yes or no without the quotes in a single line  a response yes means that the point x y is inside the house or on its boundary while no means that its outside  finally you should print the answer in the form  s without the quotes where s is an integer denoting the area of the house it can be proved that it must be integer  then terminate your program  notes  for each test the house is fixed and it doesnt change during queries  its even allowed to guess the area and print the answer as  s without asking any queries  but obviously asking queries first might be useful  after submitting your program you will see which tests it passes  the first test there task   matches the example test and drawings from this statement  asking more than  queries or printing invalid coordinates not from allowed range results in the verdict wa wrong answer  printing the answer doesnt count as asking a query  in particular you can ask exactly  queries and print the answer after that   you cant ask more queries after printing the answer  you can ask the same query more than once   subtasks  subtask   points the absolute values of the coordinates of vertices dont exceed   subtask   points original constraints absolute values of coordinates can be up to   example you system       yes       yes       no      yes      yes      no      no      yes    explanation the example test matches the drawing from the statement  the square has side  while the triangle has base  and height   the answer is                 above you can see an example of communication with the system  for example the first query asks about the point    it is on the boundary so the response is yes  on the drawing below blue and red points denote queries with response yes and no respectively     author ★errichto tester ★errichto editorial  codechef comproblemsqhouse tags                                   binary search on answer                                                              algorithms searching binary search                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
