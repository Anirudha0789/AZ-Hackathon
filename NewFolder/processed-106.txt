  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  yesterday puppy tuzik learned a magically efficient method to find the sum of the integers from  to n  he denotes it as sumn  but today as a true explorer he defined his own new function sumd n which means the operation sum applied d times the first time to n and each subsequent time to the result of the previous operation  for example if d   and n   then sum  equals to sumsum  sum      sum    tuzik wants to calculate some values of the sumd n function  will you help him with that input the first line contains a single integer t the number of test cases  each test case is described by a single line containing two integers d and n  output for each testcase output one integer on a separate line  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ d n ≤                          sample input                                                          sample output                               author ★pavel tester ★kostyaby editorial  codechef comproblemsppsum tags                                   loops basic maths implementation                                                              basic programming concepts mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
