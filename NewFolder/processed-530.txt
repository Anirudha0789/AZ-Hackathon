 its time of raksha bandhan so its compulsory for every  brother to give a gift to his sister   brother jon is planning to give a string s of length  l to his sister arya   after receiving the gift from her brother arya decided to share  the string with her brother jon    string s contains characters from index  to  index l     she will select a pivot called p ie any index p ≤ p ≤ l   and divides the original string into two parts  first  part will contain characters from index  to index p   and second part will contain characters from index  p to l    jon will keep the first part and arya will keep the second  part   arya is great fan of lcp longest common prefix so she  decided that she will select such an index as pivot such that   lcp of the two part is high  though she like lcp but she does not know how to calculate  it  help her to solve the problem  arya will ask you q questions  each question is  represented by a index p and you have to answer the lcp longest common prefix of the two parts  input  first line of input contains a string s    second line of input contains a positive number q  representing the number of question arya will ask you    q lines will follow each containing a positive  number p  output  output q numbersthe required answer  each number  on a separate line  constraints   ≤ length of the stringor l  ≤      ≤ p ≤ l      ≤ qnumber of queries ≤  all characters in the string will be small case english alphabets az  note c users please do not use cin and cout as test cases are huge prefer scanf and printf example input abababa      output      explanation  for the first query first part is a and second part is bababa hence lcp is     for the second query first part is ab and second part is ababa hence lcp is     for the third query first part is aba and second part is baba hence lcp is     for the fourth query first part is ababab and second part is a hence lcp is      author ★amanmittal editorial  codechef comproblemsinsqa tags                                   amanmittal binarysearch hashing insq rabinkarp zalgorithm                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages java c cpp pyp  submit
