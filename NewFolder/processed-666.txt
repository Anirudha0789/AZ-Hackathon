  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  the apocalyptic demon kali is on a rampage  the ground shudders under his feet trees shrivel and animals and birds scurry away from his path  in order to save the universe from devastation all the devtas led by devraj indra decide to meditate to please lord vishnu so that he appears in the form of kalki his last avatar and kill the demon  each devta can sit in meditation at a particular place on swarglok the heaven  considering swarglok as a dimensional plane the position of each devta is a fixed point with integer coordinates  the positions of all the devtas are distinct from each other  while meditating the devtas connect to each other by means of astral projections  metaphysical threads that connect one devta to another  they must do so in such a way to satisfy two criteria  each devta must be able to connect to every other devta by following a path of astral projections  no subgroup of devtas may be connected by a cycle of astral projections  in simple terms the astral projections must form a tree connecting all devtas  what needs to be optimized  once the devtas have taken their positions and are connected as a single group to start meditation a ring of influence is formed around each devta  this ring is centered at the position of the devta and has a radius equal to the euclidean distance from this devta to the furthest devta directly connected via an astral projection  since different devtas have their own supernatural powers indra is the rain god agni is the fire godvaruna is the water god vayu is the air god  etc the influence ring of each devta has an adverse effect on all other devtas which lie within or on this ring  in other words the efficiency of a devta to perform meditation decreases as the number of influence rings that include him increases  for each devta di define ci as the number of influence rings that include or touch di including their own  now devraj indra wants the devtas to connect in such a manner so as to minimize the maximum value of ci over all devtas  so he has sent a message to bhulok the earth and he needs help from the best programmers on the planet  input the first line contains the number of test cases t  each test case starts with an integer n where n denotes the number of devtas  then n lines follow  the ith such line consists of two integers xi and yi specifying the coordinates of the ith devta  output for each test case output exactly n lines  each line should consist of two integers specifying a pair of devtas between whom an astral projection should be formed  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ x i ≤   ≤ y i ≤     scoring and test data generation the score is c where c  maxci for   i  n  the sequence of positions for devtas is generated randomly and the positions are distributed uniformly  example input              example of a valid output           explanation the second devta is connected to two other devtas the first devta a distance of  away and the third devta a distance of sqrt away  the larger of these distances is  so the radius of the second devtas ring of influence is   we can calculate the other rings similarly  here is a diagram with the astral projections represented in red and all of the influence rings represented in blue   the second devta lies within three rings of influence  the first devtas the second devtas himself and the third devtas  we can calculate the other values similarly c   c   c   c   c    the maximum of these values is  so you would get a score of   other possible outputs may result in higher or lower scores  your objective is to minimize your score   author snigdhaadm tester ★xiaodao editorial  codechef comproblemskalki tags                                   challenge dec graphs optimization radionetworks snigdhaadm trees                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
