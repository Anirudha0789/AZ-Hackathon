 read problem statements in mandarin chinese vietnamese and russian nishant does pretty weird stuff  today he wants to create a weird sequence  according to nishant a sequence aa of length nn is called weird if  n≥n≥ ⋅aiai−aixa∀i∈    n−⋅aiai−aixa∀i∈    n−  nishant wants to construct a long weird sequence to impress his weird friends but theres a problem  he only knows how to count up to kk so the sequence can only contain integers in the range kk   help nishant determine the length of the longest weird sequence he can construct using only integers from  to kk  input format  the first line contains a single integer tt denoting the number of testcases  the description of tt testcases follows  the first and only line of each testcase contains a single integer kk   output format for each testcase print one line containing a single integer  the maximum length of a weird sequence which can be obtained using only integers in kk  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤k≤≤k≤                         sample input                                                         sample output                               explanation test case  one possible weird sequence is   it can be shown that there is no weird sequence with length   test case  one possible weird sequence is   it can be shown that there is no weird sequence with length    author utkarshadm editorial  codechef comproblemshlpnishant tags                                   greedy adhoc                                                              algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
