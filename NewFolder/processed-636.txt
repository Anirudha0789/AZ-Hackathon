  tomya is a girl  she loves chef ciel very much  since tomya has completed collecting the stamps in ciels restaurant she now challenges the bonus game in her restaurant  there are colored balls in a box  the number of colors is n and the number of balls color i in the box is si for i        n initially  at first tomya has m coins  and tomyas aim in this game is to get many coins at the end of the game  this game will run as follows  tomya chooses a color and tomya bets some coins suppose x coins are bet on the color  here x must be nonnegative integer at most l and tomya must have x coins before betting  then ciel chooses a ball from the box checks its color and discards the ball  if the ball has the same color as tomyas bet then tomya gets b·x coins otherwise tomya must pay x coins  note that if tomya wins then she receives back her bet as well as b·x coins  while the box has at least one ball the above process are repeated  when the box is empty the game is over  the game is very kind because tomya always can increase her coins  instead of this ciel is not kind in this game she chooses the balls which minimize tomyas coins at the end of the game yes she can choose balls as she likes  your task is to calculate the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by tomya at the end of the game   input  the first line contains an integer t the number of test cases  then t test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains  integers n b m l  then the next line contains n integers s s     sn   output  for each test case print the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by tomya at the end of the game   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n b ≤   ≤ m l ≤    ≤ si ≤   sample input               sample output   explanations  in the first sample one of the strategy to obtain  coins is as follow at first tomya bets  coins  let the color  be chosen by ciel  now s   s   coins   then tomya bets  coins on the color    if the color  is chosen she will get  coins   now s   s   coins    in next turn tomya bets  coins and let color  be chosen   now s   s   coins    lastly tomya bets all  coins on the color  and she will get  coins   game over with s   s   coins    if the color  is chosen in the second turn she must lose  coins   now s   s   coins    in this case tomya bets all  coins on the color  and she will get  coins   now s   s   coins    then once more tomya bets all  coins on the color  and she will get  coins   game over with s   s   coins   in the second sample tomya has only  coin  therefore tomya must not bet her coin while the box contains balls of at least  different colors  ciel must always choose a ball of the most popular color  so while the box has at least two balls there always exist two balls of different colors in the box  so tomya can bet her coin only on the last ball    author hirotoadm editorial  codechef comproblemscielball tags                                   binarysearch cook dynamicprogramming hard hirotoadm                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
