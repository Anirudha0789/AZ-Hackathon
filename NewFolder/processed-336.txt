 given a matrix  of size nxnnxn you have to reach the middle point of the matrix by breaking all the boundaries from any one  point i e  any no on ij of boundary or the perimeter in one box  if you break any one element on a boundary then you can directly go to the next inner boundary or inner box then you have to break this box and further move in until you have reached the middle of the square matrix  if the side of the square matrix is odd then you have to break this middle element too   each element of this matrix has a particular energy that is consumed in breaking this element  now tell me what is the minimum energy consumed in moving to its middle   square matrix has side nn  boundaries in matrix can be created as follow  for this case ansans input  first line will contain nn side of the square  then the testcases follow   a matrix of size nnnn   containing integer values aiai  output for each testcase output in a single line answer the minimum energy required to reach the centre  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤  sample input                            sample output   explanation first we will break outer box from  then inner box with energy  so total energy consumed is    author ★aayushindwan editorial  codechef comproblemsboxinbox tags                                   aayushindwan adhoc greedy strt                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
