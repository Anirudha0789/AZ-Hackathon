 chef likes to play with array elements  his teacher has given him an array problem  but now he is busy as christmas is coming  so he needs your help  can you help him to solve this problem  you are given an array aaa……anaaa……an of length nn  you have to create an another array using the given array in the following ways for each valid i the ith element of the output array will be the sum of the ith element and aith element if aiai is less equal nn  other wise for each valid i following the step below i divide the value of aiai by  untill it will be less thannn  ii then find the difference dd between nn and aiai  iii the ith element of the output array will be dthdth element    input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows    the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn    the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an      output  for each testcase print new array in each line   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤aa     an≤≤aa     an≤  sample input             sample output          explanation for st test case a    a     a     a  n  so a   then a  a   aa and a a  then array becomes    author ★sourav editorial  codechef comproblemsnbc tags                                   array noob sourav                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
