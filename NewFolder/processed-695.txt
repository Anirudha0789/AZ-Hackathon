 you are given a family tree with nn members numbered    n   n  every person ii except for the founder of the family root has a parent denoted by pipi  prootproot   by definition  person ii is a descendant of person jj if ii belongs to the subtree rooted at jj  the net worth adjusted for inflation is given for all the members of the family  your task is to find the maximum difference in net worths of two members where one member is a descendant of the other      you can assume that no two members of this family married each other  so it remains a family tree   input  first line will contain  an integer nn denoting the number of members   second line contains n space seperated integers w w … wn denoting the networth of the n members   third line contains  n space seperated integers p p … pn denoting the parents of the n members   output output in a single line the maximum difference in net worths of any two members where one member is a descendant of the other  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ −≤wi≤−≤wi≤ ≤pi≤n≤pi≤n  sample input              sample output   explanation this structure of the tree is                                                                         the maximum difference occurs between the rd and th members  w−ww−w    author ★bluishgreen tags                                   bluishgreen depthfirstsearch dynamicprogramming easymedium graphs jp trees                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs pypy php js  submit
