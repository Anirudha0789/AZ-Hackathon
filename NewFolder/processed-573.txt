 bheem is playing a game with jaggu  jaggu gives bheem nn strings and asked him to find the length of the shortest consecutive subarray such that the characters of the string in the given subarray can be used to form the word given by jaggu  he ask qq such questions each question consist of a word  bheem is not able to solve these queries as he gives his laddus to nitnit topper  so he want you to calculate the minimum length of the subarray  if not possible print −−  input  first line will contain nn number of strings jaggu gives to bheem   next nn lines contains a string ss  the next line contains qq number of questions jaggu asks  next qq lines contains a string     output for each testcase output in a single line the minimum length of the subarray  such that the characters of the string in that range can be use to produce that word ask by jaggu  if not any subarray possible  print −−  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤q≤≤q≤ sum of lenght of all the strings in input ≤≤  sum of the lenth of all the strings in queries ≤≤    sample input    adew  rdwq  cgr    aw  rrc  sample output      explanation for first query string adew can be use to form the wordaw  so min length   for second query string   rdwg cgr  can be use to form the word  rrc   so min length     author ★piyushbhutani editorial  codechef comproblemsbjaggu tags                                   binarysearch easymedium piyushbhutani smtc                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
