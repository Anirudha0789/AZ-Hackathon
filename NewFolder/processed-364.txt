 read problems statements in mandarin chinese  russian and vietnamese as well  after six days professor gukiz decided to give more candies to his students  like last time he has nn students numbered  through nn  lets denote the number of candies gukiz gave to the iith student by pipi  as gukiz has a lot of students he does not remember all the exact numbers of candies he gave to the students  he only remembers the following properties of the sequence pp  the numbers of candies given to each of the first kk students pp…pkpp…pk are known exactly  all elements of the sequence pp are distinct and positive  gukiz didnt give more than xx candies to any student the maximum value in the sequence pp is not greater than xx  for each student ii there is at least one other student jj such that pi−pj≤dpi−pj≤d  the professor gave out the biggest possible total number of candies i e  sppp…pnsppp…pn is maximum possible   gukiz would like to know the total number of candies ss he had at the beginning  however times change and after six days the professor is really tired so it is possible that there is no sequence pp which satisfies the constraints  can you help gukiz find the number of candies he gave out or tell him that he must have made a mistake input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains four spaceseparated integers nn kk xx dd  the second line contains kk distinct spaceseparated integers pp…pkpp…pk   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the number of candies gukiz had or −− if there is no valid sequence pp  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤minn⋅≤k≤minn⋅  ≤x≤⋅≤x≤⋅ ≤d≤≤d≤ ≤pi≤x≤pi≤x for each valid ii all values pipi from input are distinct  subtasks subtask   points ≤xnd≤≤xnd≤  subtask   points ≤xnd≤≤xnd≤  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                   sample output                              explanation example case  there are four students  we know that the first student got pp candies the second student got pp and the third got pp candies we dont know the number of candies given to the last student  the maximum possible amount of candies given to some student is xx  the best possible option is giving pp candies to the last student  then the fourth constraint with dd is satisfied for all students  only the pair of students  have numbers of candies that differ by more than  but still for each student there are at least two other students with close enough numbers of candies  example case  gukiz made some mistake in distribution and there is no valid sequence pp  the answer is −−   author ★allllekssssa editorial  codechef comproblemsghmc tags                                   constructive sorting                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
