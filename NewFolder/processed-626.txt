 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well   tfehc is chefs best friend  they grew up with each other and often help each other with competitive programming   tchef is participating in a programming contest prepared by fehc and finds the following problem in fehcs problem set given a string s  n count the number of pairs of indices  ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n such that si  j is palindrome and ji is even  the characters that may appear in s are           tchef doesnt know the solution but he knows fehcs habits of creating test data  when preparing data for a string problem fehc always generates a string of n s and replaces some of the s by other characters  thus chef assumes that there are only k nonzero characters in s and k is usually much smaller than n   tgiven this useful information can you help chef solve this problem  tinput  the first line of input contains one integer t denoting the number of test cases  for each test case the first line contains two spaceseparated integers n and k  k lines follow the ith of these lines contains two spaceseparated integers pi and qi meaning that the ith nonzero character is spi  qi  toutput  tfor each test case output one integer denoting the answer to the problem   tconstraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ k ≤   ≤ p  p       pk ≤ n  ≤ qi ≤  tsubtask   points  n ≤  tsubtask   points  n ≤  tsubtask   points  k ≤  tsubtask   points  original constraints                         sample input                                                                      sample output                               explanation  example case  s  the  pairs ij are         and    example case  s   example case  s   author ★r editorial  codechef comproblemschefpchf tags                                   hashing binary search manachers algorithm                                                              algorithms searching string algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
