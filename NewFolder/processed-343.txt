 chef wants to teach a lesson of sharing to the students  there are nn students numbered from  to nn from left to right who are asked to stand in a row  initially chef gave aaii candies to the iithth child  in one operation any child can give any number of candies to the child standing to his immediate left i e  iithth child can give any amount of candies to the i−i−thth child  in particular st child cannot give his candies to anyone    he asked them to minimize the maximum value of candies a student can possess after performing any number of operations possibly zero   help the students finding such maximum value  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  first line of each test case contains a single integer nn denoting the number of students  second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aaaa           aann denoting the initial amount of candies chef gave to them   output  for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― maximum value after sharing   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  ≤≤ aaii ≤≤  sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   sample input                  sample output       explanation  for first test case the thth student will give  candies to thth student and thth will give  candies to rdrd and rdrd will give  candies to ndnd and ndnd will give  candies to stst  so finally the number of candies that they will have are   and the value of maximum candies is   for second test case sharing to the left student will not change the maximum value as stst cannot share to anyone  so the maximum value will remain     author ★aman editorial  codechef comproblemscocr tags                                   aman cros greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
