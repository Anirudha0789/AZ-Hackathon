 chef is working on his swapbased sorting algorithm for strings  given a string ss of length nn he wants to know whether he can sort the string using his algorithm  according to the algorithm one can perform the following operation on string ss any number of times  choose some index ii ≤i≤n≤i≤n and swap the ithith character from the front and the ithith character from the back  more formally choose an index ii and swap sisi and sn−isn−i   for example d––cba––dcba can be converted to a––cbd––acbd using one operation where ii  help chef find if it is possible to sort the string using any possibly zero number of operations  input format  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains nn the length of the string  the second line contains a string ss of length nn consisting of lowercase letters of the latin alphabet   output format for each test case print yesyes if it is possible to sort the string by performing any number of operations  otherwise print nono  you may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase for example the strings yesyes yesyes yesyes and yesyes will all be treated as identical  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅  ss consists of lowercase latin alphabets only                          sample input                              dbca  ccc  bza                          sample output                            yes yes no explanation test case  chef can sort the string using  operation   choose ii and swap sdsd and sasa  this way the string becomes abcdabcd   hence the string is sorted  test case  chef needs  operations to sort this string as it is already sorted  test case  it can be proven that the given string cannot be sorted using any number of operations   author ★pdcodes tags                                   string sorting                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
