  read problems statements in mandarin chinese and russian as well  xa andrii is a great programmer  he recently managed to enter ukrainian ioi team  his parents wanted to appreciate him and present him a dagdirected acyclic graph  his favourite tv show is pimp my ride so hed like to customize his graph  hed like to add as many edges as possible in order to still have a dag  please help andrii find the maximum number of edges he can add to his graph without obtaining any cycle   xa input the first line of an input contains single integer n — the number of vertices in the graph  vertices are numerated from  to n  next n lines contain n characters each — adjacency matrix of the graph  if there is  in jth character of the ith line then there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j in andriis graph  its guaranteed that given graph does not contain cycles   xa output output the maximal number of edges one can add to the graph in the first line  then output the edges themselves  edges should be written in separate lines one by one  edge is defined by a pair of integers a and b which means that edge from a to b should be added   the author is pretty lazy and he does not want to write checking program  so if there are multiple solutions which lead to maximal number of edges that can be added then you should output lexicographically smallest sequence of edges  a sequence of edges is smaller than another if the first edge that they differ in is lexicographically smaller  edges are compared as pairs of integers i e  as sequence of two integers   xa constraints  ≤ n ≤   xa example input      output       xa  author romanadm tester ★shiplu editorial  codechef comproblemsrrdag tags                                   topological sorting                                                              algorithms graph algos dag algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
