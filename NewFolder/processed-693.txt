 in a market of mangoes there are nn sellers numbered from  to nn  the iith seller initially charges a price of aiai coins for each of their mangoes  however the sellers are very competitive and they will change prices based on other sellers nearby  you have a simple graph unweighted undirected graph containing no selfloops or multiple edges gg with nn vertices and mm edges  there is an edge between two sellers if and only if they are neighbours  when you buy a mango from a seller numbered xx the following occurs  seller xx keeps his price the same  every seller yy who is a neighbour of xx increases their price by  that is ayayayay for every yy who is a neighbour of xx  every other seller zz who is not a neighbour of xx decreases their price by  that is azaz−azaz− for every zz who is not a neighbour of xx   prices can become zero or negative during this process  now you should process qq queries of the following three types   uu vv — add an edge between nodes uu and vv in the graph  its guaranteed there is no edge between uu and vv currently   uu vv — remove an edge between nodes uu and vv in the graph  its guaranteed there is an edge between uu and vv currently   — find the minimum amount of money you need to pay so that you can buy exactly one mango from every seller  after queries of this type the prices of all sellers are reset to their initial value   input format  the first line contains two integers nn and mm  the number of sellers and the number of edges in the graph  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an denoting the price array aa  the next mm lines each contain two integers uu and vv ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n u≠vu≠v representing an edge of gg   the next line contains the integer qq — the number of queries   the next qq lines contain the queries  each query is in the format given in the problem statement  there is at least one query of type    output format for each query of type  output one integer — the minimum amount of money you need to pay so that you can buy exactly one mango from each seller  constraints  ≤nq≤≤nq≤ ≤m≤minn≤m≤minn ≤ai≤≤ai≤ its guaranteed that gg is a simple graph that is it is an unweighted undirected graph containing no selfloops or multiple edges                          sample input                                                                                sample output                              explanation in the sample test the first query of type  is pictured below  the iith node from left to right contains the price of the iith seller  if we buy mangoes from the sellers     in that order then we can pay    and  coins for the mangoes respectively paying a total  coins  it can be proven that this is indeed the minimum amount possible  it can be proven that for the second query of type  the minimum amount we can pay is  coins  note that the prices of the mangoes reset after each query of type    author ★flamestorm editorial  codechef comproblemsmangomkt tags                                   cook easy flamestorm graphs observation                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
