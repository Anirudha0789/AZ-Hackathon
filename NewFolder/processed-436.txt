 you are provided a number nn  in one step you can either divide nn by if nn is  or multiply nn by    find the minimum number of steps required to get  from nn or check if it is not possible  input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   the only line of the test case contains a number nn    output for each test case print   the minimum number of steps required to get  from nn it is possible to do           −− it is impossible to obtain  from nn   constraints  ≤t≤⋅≤t≤⋅ ≤n≤≤n≤ nn is integer  sample input                           sample output                     explanation consider the fourth test case  divide nn by  four times in a row and get  updated nn  multiply nn by  and get   divide nn by  three times in a row and get  updated nn  multiply by  and get  divide nn by  three times in a row and get    author ★arpit editorial  codechef comproblemsfinstp tags                                   arpit bruteforce cplusplus graphs greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
