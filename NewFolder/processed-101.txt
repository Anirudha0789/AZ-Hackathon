 the most important part of a gsm network is so called base transceiver station bts  these transceivers form the areas called cells this term gave the name to the cellular phone and every phone connects to the bts with the strongest signal in a little simplified view  of course btses need some attention and technicians need to check their function periodically    the technicians faced a very interesting problem recently  given a set of btses to visit they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the given points and return back to the central company building  programmers have spent several months studying this problem but with no results  they were unable to find the solution fast enough  after a long time one of the programmers found this problem in a conference article  unfortunately he found that the problem is so called traveling salesman problem and it is very hard to solve  if we have nn btses to be visited we can visit them in any order giving us nn  possibilities to examine  the function expressing that number is called factorial and can be computed as a product        n       n  the number is very high even for a relatively small nn  the programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem  but because they have already received the research grant from the government they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least some results  so they started to study behaviour of the factorial function    for example they defined the function zz  for any positive integer nn zznn is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number nn  they noticed that this function never decreases  if we have two numbers nnnn then  zn≤znzn≤zn  it is because we can never lose any trailing zero by multiplying by any positive number  we can only get new and new zeros  the function zz is very interesting so we need a computer program that can determine its value efficiently  input there is a single positive integer tt on the first line of input equal to about   it stands for the number of numbers to follow  then there are tt lines each containing exactly one positive integer number nn ≤n≤≤n≤  output for every number nn output a single line containing the single nonnegative integer znzn  sample input         sample output         author uadmincodechefpw editorial  codechef comproblemsfctrl tags                                   factorials                                                              mathematics basic maths                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
