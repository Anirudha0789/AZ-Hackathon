 lakshika was bringing some laddus to her home for diwali celebration  but on her way some of the laddus fell on the road   there is a cat on the road  consider that the house of lakshika is at a distance of n from the cats initial position  consider that all laddus lie between the cat and lakshika’s home in one straight line  more than one laddu can be present at one point  the ith laddu is located at a distance xi from the initial position of the cat   in one second the following happens  first lakshika can exactly move any one laddu by  position towards her house  if lakshika is able to move the laddu to her home she hides the laddu i e  lakshika will not move this laddu any more to any point and it will not be eaten by the cat  then after lakshika has finished her move the cat moves by  position towards lakshika’s house  if at the new cats position some laddus are present the cat eats them all   the actions are performed until any laddu hasnt been hidden in the house or isnt eaten  in other words the first move is made by lakshika  if any laddu has been hidden in the house its saved  then the cat makes a move  the cat eats the laddus located at the point the cat has reached if the cat has reached the house the cat can’t eat any laddu now  each second lakshika can select any laddu that she wishes to move  what is the maximum number of laddus that she can take to her house input format  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow  each test case consists of two lines  the first line contains two integers n and k  the second line contains k integers xx…xk the initial distance of the laddus from the initial position of the cat   output format for each test case output on a separate line an integer m m≥  the maximum number of laddus that lakshika can take home  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤∗≤k≤∗ ≤xin≤xin                         sample input                                                                                     sample output                                author ★saksham tester ★amishagarg editorial  codechef comproblemssavl tags                                   easy greedy saksham                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
