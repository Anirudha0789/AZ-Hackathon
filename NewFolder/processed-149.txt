 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  alice and bob are playing a game  alice initially has the number a and bob has the number b  there are a total of n turns in the game and alice and bob alternatively take turns  in each turn the player whose turn it is multiplies his or her number by   alice has the first turn  suppose after all the n turns alices number has become c and bobs number has become d  you want to calculate the integer division of the maximum number among c and d by the minimum number among c and d  input  the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of each testcase follows  each test case contains a single line with  integers a b and n   output for each test case output a new line with a single integer which should be the answer  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ a ≤   ≤ b ≤   ≤ n ≤   subtasks  subtask   points n ≤  subtask   points original constraints                         sample input                                                               sample output                               explanation in the first testcase the initial numbers are a   b    there is only one turn  in this turn alice multiplies her number by   hence we get a   b    therefore c   and d    maxc dminc d      hence the first output is   in the second testcase the initial numbers are a   b    there three turns  in the first turn alice multiplies her number by   hence we get a   b    in the second turn bob multiplies his number by   hence we get a   b    in the third turn alice multiplies her number by   hence we get a   b    therefore c   and d    maxc dminc d      hence the second output is   in the third testcase the initial numbers are a   b    there two turns  in the first turn alice multiplies her number by   hence we get a   b    in the second turn bob multiplies his number by   hence we get a   b    therefore c   and d    maxc dminc d     because we are doing integer division  hence the third output is    author ★grumpygordon tester ★lg editorial  codechef comproblemstwonms tags                                   integer division adhoc                                                              mathematics basic maths algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
