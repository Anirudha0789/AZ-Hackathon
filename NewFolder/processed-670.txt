 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese russian vietnamese and bengali as well  you are given a sequence of integers aa…anaa…an  you may change any number of its elements possibly zero obtaining a new sequence of positive integers bb…bnbb…bn  each element of bb must be an integer between  and  both inclusive  lets define an undirected graph gg with nn vertices numbered  through nn  for each pair of different vertices ii and jj there is an edge between ii and jj if and only if bibi and bjbj are coprime  you should choose the sequence bb in such a way that gg is a connected graph  the number of elements which need to be changed to obtain bb from aa should be minimum possible  find one such sequence bb and the minimum required number of changes  it can be proven that a solution always exists — it is always possible to modify sequence aa in such a way that gg is connected  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an   output for each test case print two lines  the first line should contain a single integer — the minimum required number of changes  the second line should contain nn spaceseparated integers bb…bnbb…bn — the modified sequence  if there are multiple solutions you may print any one  constraints  ≤t≤⋅≤t≤⋅ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points original constraints example input         example output        explanation example  there is an edge in gg between vertices  and   this graph is connected so there is no need to change any elements  example  there is no edge between vertices  and  since gcd≠gcd≠  this graph is not connected  we can change element aa to  and make this graph connected   author admin editorial  codechef comproblemsarrgraph tags                                   disjoint set union                                                              advanced data structures                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
