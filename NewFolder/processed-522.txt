 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given a sequence of n integers a a     an and an integer d  find the length of the shortest nonempty contiguous subsequence with sum of elements at least d  formally you should find the smallest positive integer k with the following property there is an integer s  ≤ s ≤ nk such that as  as       ask ≥ d  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers n and d  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the length of the shortest contiguous subsequence with sum of elements ≥ d  if there is no such subsequence print  instead  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ d ≤   ≤ ai ≤   ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤  ·                          sample input                                                                    sample output                               author ★chemthan tester ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemsminsubar tags                                   divide and conquer                                                              algorithms recursion                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
