 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chefland is a country with nn cities numbered  through nn connected by mm bidirectional roads  chef is on a mission to spread a secret recipe of a rogan josh dish  chef has a sequence aa…akaa…ak and he must visit cities in the following way he starts in the city aa travels to the city aa then travels from there to the city aa and so on until he reaches the city akak  note that a city may appear in aa multiple times but ai≠aiai≠ai for each valid ii  when travelling between two cities chef always follows one of the shortest paths between them but not necessarily the same one if he travels between them again  the government is trying to track which cities are targeted by chef  however they do not know the sequence aa  instead they have tracked chefs movement as a sequence bb…blbb…bl of cities visited by chef during his mission  formally baba is the city where chef starts then for each valid ii he moves from the city bibi to the city bibi using the direct road between them and finally he ends his mission in the city blakblak chefs sequence aa is a subsequence of bb since the sequence bb also contains all shortest paths which chef followed  it is guaranteed that there is a direct road between cities bibi and bibi for each valid ii  help the government of chefland find the minimum possible number of targeted cities i e  the minimum possible value of kk for a sequence aa that corresponds to the given sequence bb or determine that no such sequence aa exists  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains three spaceseparated integers nn mm and ll  the second line contains ll spaceseparated integers bb…blbb…bl  each of the following mm lines contains three spaceseparated integers uu vv and ww describing a road between cities uu and vv with length ww   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum possible kk or −− if a valid sequence aa does not exist  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤m≤n⋅n−≤m≤n⋅n− ≤l≤≤l≤ ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n u≠vu≠v ≤w≤≤w≤ there is at most one direct road between each pair of cities for each valid ii there is a direct road between cities bibi and bibi  subtasks subtask   points ww subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                                                              sample output                                author admin editorial  codechef comproblemssecretmi tags                                   graphs greedy floyd warshalls algorithm dijkstras algorithm                                                              data structures algorithms graph algos shortest paths                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
