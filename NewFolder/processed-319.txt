 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you have nn piles of spoons numbered …n…n  initially the iith pile contains aiai spoons   in a single operation you can do the following  choose three integers pqxpqx satisfying ≤pq≤n≤pq≤n p≠qp≠q ≤x≤ap≤aq≤x≤ap≤aq  shift xx spoons from pile pp to pile qq that is add xx to aqaq and subtract xx from apap   you want to shift all spoons to pile   it can be proved that if it is possible to shift all spoons to pile  then there exists a sequence of ≤n≤n operations which achieves this objective  either find such a sequence of ≤n≤n operations  or claim that no such sequence exists  input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   the first line of each testcase contains a single integer nn  the second line contains nn space separated integers aa…anaa…an   output for each testcase  if it is impossible to shift all spoons to the first pile print −−  else first print the number of operations say kk which must be ≤n≤n on a new line then print kk lines  the iith line should contain the pqpq and xx you chose in the iith operation  if the triple pqxpqx doesnt satisfy ≤pq≤np≠q≤x≤ap≤aq≤pq≤np≠q≤x≤ap≤aq you get a wrong answer verdict   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ the sum of nn over all testcases doesnt exceed   ≤ai≤≤ai≤ the total number of spoons doesnt exceed   subtasks subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                             sample output                                                explanation in the first example aa   first choose pqxpqx  after this operation aa  now choose pqxpqx  now aa as required   in the second example we will never be able to shift spoons from the second pile to the first  so we print −−   author ★jtnydv editorial  codechef comproblemsshspoons tags                                   sets greedy                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
