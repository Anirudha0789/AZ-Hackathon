 read problems statements in russian vietnamese hindi mandarin chinese and bengali as well  in between cooking lunch and dinner chef has decided to take some time off to read about the activity selection problem  in that problem there are mm time intervals lrlr…lmrmlrlr…lmrm  a solution to the problem is a maximum subset of these intervals such that no two intervals from this subset have a common point sharing an endpoint is also forbidden i e  a set containing the maximum possible number of such intervals  since solving this problem proved to be too easy chef is now wondering in how many ways could he pick a set of mm distinct intervals such that all of their endpoints belong to the set …n…n and the number of intervals in the solution to the activity selection problem for this set is exactly kk since the result may be very large compute it modulo modmod  input the first and only line of the input contains four spaceseparated integers nn mm kk and modmod  output print a single line containing one integer — the number of sets of intervals which satisfy all constraints modulo modmod  constraints  ≤k≤n≤≤k≤n≤ ≤m≤minnn≤m≤minnn ≤mod≤≤mod≤ modmod is a prime  example input      example output   explanation there are exactly two possible ways to pick the intervals   and   and   example input      example output   explanation we must pick intervals  and   example input      example output    author ★andrei editorial  codechef comproblemsspectac tags                                   permutations  combinations dp approach greedy activity selection                                                              mathematics combinatorics algorithms dynamic programming                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
