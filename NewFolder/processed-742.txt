 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  get excited folks because it is time for the final match of codechef premier league cpl mike and tracy also want to watch the grand finale but unfortunately they could not get tickets to the match  however mike is not someone who gives up so easily — he has a plan to watch the match  the field where the match is played is surrounded by a wall with height kk  outside there are nn boxes numbered  through nn  for each valid ii the iith box has a height hihi  mike wants to take some boxes and stack them on top of each other to build two towers  the height of each tower is the sum of heights of all the boxes that form it  of course no box may be in both towers  the height of each tower should be at least kk  then mike can climb on top of one tower and tracy on top of the other and they can watch the match uninterrupted while mike is busy stacking the boxes tracy would like to know the smallest number of boxes required to build two towers such that each of them has height at least kk or at least that it is impossible to build such towers  can you help tracy input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and kk  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers hh…hnhh…hn   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the smallest number of boxes required to build two towers or −− if it is impossible  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nk≤≤nk≤ ≤hi≤≤hi≤ for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points  ≤nk≤≤nk≤ ≤hi≤≤hi≤ for each valid ii  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                      sample output                              explanation example case  the first tower can be built with boxes  and the second tower with boxes   in this case the box with height  is left unused  example case  we only need the box with height  for one tower and the box with height  for the other tower   author ★shivam editorial  codechef comproblemswipl tags                                   suffix sum                                                              algorithms simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
