 you are given a matrix of characters  the matrix hasxanxarows andxamxacolumns  given a stringxas you have to tell if it is possible to generate that string from given matrix  rules for generating string from matrix are  you have to pick first character of string from rowxa second character from rowxaxaand so on  thexanthxacharacter of string is to be picked from rowxa that is you can traverse the rows in a cyclic manner rowxaxacomes after rowxan  if an occurrence of a character is picked from a row you cannot pick the same occurrence again from that row   you have to printxayesxaif given string can be generated from matrix using the given rules else printxano  input format first line consists ofxat denoting the number of test cases  each test case consists of first line consists of two integersxanxaandxam denoting the matrix dimensions  followingxanxalines consist ofxamxacharacters each  the last line consists of a stringxas  output format for each test case print yes if the string can be generated else print no  answer for each test case should come in a new line  input constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n m ≤  ≤ s ≤ n∗m the matrix consists of lowercase english characters  stringxasxaconsists of lowercase english characters   example   input     aba xyz bdr axbaydb output yes   author ★bkww editorial  codechef comproblemsstrggen tags                                   array bkww easy strings                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
