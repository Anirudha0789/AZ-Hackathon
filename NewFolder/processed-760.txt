 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  motu and tomu are very good friends who are always looking for new games to play against each other and ways to win these games  one day they decided to play a new type of game with the following rules  the game is played on a sequence aa…an−aa…an−  the players alternate turns motu plays first since hes earlier in lexicographical order  each player has a score  the initial scores of both players are   on his turn the current player has to pick the element of aa with the lowest index add its value to his score and delete that element from the sequence aa  at the end of the game when aa is empty tomu wins if he has strictly greater score than motu  otherwise motu wins the game   in other words motu starts by selecting aa adding it to his score and then deleting it then tomu selects aa adds its value to his score and deletes it and so on  motu and tomu already chose a sequence aa for this game  however since tomu plays second he is given a different advantage before the game he is allowed to perform at most kk swaps in aa afterwards the two friends are going to play the game on this modified sequence  now tomu wants you to determine if it is possible to perform up to kk swaps in such a way that he can win this game  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and kk denoting the number of elements in the sequence and the maximum number of swaps tomu can perform  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…an−aa…an−   output for each test case print a single line containing the string yes if tomu can win the game or no otherwise without quotes  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points ≤n≤≤n≤ subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                     sample output                            no yes explanation example case  at the end of the game both motu and tomu will have scores   tomu is unable to win that game so the output is no  example case  if no swaps were performed motus score would be  and tomus score would be   however tomu can swap the elements aa and aa which makes motus score at the end of the game equal to  and tomus score equal to   tomu managed to score higher than motu so the output is yes   author ★bhushan editorial  codechef comproblemsmtyfri tags                                   maps                                                              data structures                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
