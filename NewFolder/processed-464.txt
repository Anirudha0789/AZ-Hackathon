 today you and chefchef went for a drive on a straight road with no cars on the highway early in the morning  but to chef’s disappointment the highway is not so smooth it has some potholes and moreover the highway has a fixed length after that it is brokenbroken  the highway is straight and is given in the form of a binary string  binary string is a string consisting of only s and s  s representing the highway is smoothsmooth at that point and s representing the highway has potholespotholes in that position  chef’s car has initial fuel in the car as ff which represents the distance the car can travel with that much fuel  chef’s car has a reserve fuel in it too but at any point it can be used for increasing the fuel from ff to ff  assume he has unlimited reserve fuel but can only use  unit of it to increase ff to ff at a stopping point and as soon as ff becomes  he will not be able to use his reserve fuel anymore  chef can use f−f− fuel or ff fuel and due to the reserve he can also use ff fuel  so he has  points to stop at f−pfpfpf−pfpfp where p is the current position and at those points the fuel for the next part of the journey will be f−fff−ff respectively  chef stops when he has  fuel left with him and in this case he can’t use his reserve fuel  but he can’t stop at a position with a pothole  so he asks you to tell him that will he be able to stop on a flat surface and not a pothole until his fuel ff becomes  within the bounds of the highway  if there is still fuel left till the end of the highway then he will not stop within the bounds of the highway and the answer would be nono otherwise the answer is yesyes if he stops within the highway and always stops at flat surfaces   input first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow  each testcase contains two lines  first line contains an integer nn the length of the highway and ff initial fuel  second line contains a string ss consisting of ss and ss   output for each testcase output in a single line the answer  yes or no   constraints ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤f≤n≤f≤n  subtasks subtask  points ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤f≤n≤f≤n subtask  points ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤f≤n≤f≤n subtask  points original constraints  sample input            sample output yes yes no  explanation for the first case he starts at position  and from position  he has  options to chose i e  to index   or   he will not chose  because there is a pothole where he has to stop at   he will chose index  and will stop there  now at index  he has a fuel of  so he again have options of going at  and he will go to index  and stop there  at index  now he has a fuel of  unit  so he can now use no fuel optionbecause he can chose  fuel and hence has stopped  for the second case he starts at position  with a fuel of  and he can stop there itself choosing the no fuel optionf and can stop there only  for the last case there will be no way in which chef could stop himself within the bound of the highway there will be still fuel left   author pecchapter editorial  codechef comproblemschdf tags                                   dynamicprogramming greedy pecchapter recursion ucsp                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
