  chef has decided to take a break and go for a ride  he is currently in city  and he wants to get to city n  the cities along the road from  to n are numbered         n n in increasing order of distance from city   the distance between cities i and i is denoted by di   however as is always the case it is unsafe to travel at night so he will have to break his journey over multiple days  chef may travel at most d distance in any day so he will have to book hotel for overnight stay in some of the cities  on any day chef will begin his journey from some city and end his journey at some other city  chef wants to reach city n in as few days as possible so he has to plan his trip accordingly  let l be the minimum number of days in which he can reach city n   chef knows the cost of overnight stay in each city  the cost of overnight stay in city i is ci  chef will need to get all his hotel bills reembersed and his boss might get suspicious if cost for any single day exceeds a threshold   chef knows that his boss wants him to reach as soon as possible  thus if it is possible for chef to go from  to n in l days with no restriction on where chef stays then his boss will want him to reach in exactly l days  however if the boss puts a threshold value i then we know that the chef may not be able to reach in l days since he may not be allowed to stay at some hotels  help him him find the minimum threshold value c such that if he only stays in hotels of cost  c it is possible for him to reach the destination n in exactly l days remember here l is the minimum number of days needed by chef if there were absolutely no restrictions on where he stays   formally let l be the minimal number of days it takes chef to get from city  to city n  let fi be the minimal number of days it takes chef to get from city  to city n if its not allowed to pay more than i for a single stay in hotel  find the smallest c that will still allow chef to get to city n without losing time  in other words fcl  find and output l as well   input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case has two space separated integers n and d  n lines follow each having two space separated integers di and ci   output for each test case output a separate line containing the values of l and c   constraints   ≤ t ≤    ≤ n ≤    ≤ d ≤    ≤ di ≤ d  ≤ ci ≤ n the sum of n over all test cases in any file is at most   subtack   points n ≤   subtack   points di   d    subtask   points   no special constraints  example sample input                        sample output     explanation for test case  the optimal trip is  →  →  for test case  the optimal trip is  →  →  →   author ★utkarshlath tester  editorial  codechef comproblemstripcost tags                                   greedy binary search on answer                                                              algorithms searching binary search                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
