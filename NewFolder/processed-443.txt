 xa under the digital india initiative google decided to provide free wifi for  minutes at various railway stations in india  however the number of passengers expected to use the wifi and the wifi charges differ from station to station  we are provided with a list of n railway stations the number of passengers expected to use it per station wifi charges per station and we are supposed to set up wifi connection at k stations out of the n such that we have an optimal solution where we can maximise the number of passengers served in minimum cost i e  we need to maximise the ratio summationpisummationpici where pi is the no  of passengers expected to use the wifi at the ith station and ci is the cost of wifi for  mins  per passenger at the ith station  for example consider the table given below   s  no  station name pi ci raipur gondia bilaspur durg bhilai power house nagpur jharsuguda rourkela hatia titilagarh input input description   the first line of input will contain the integer n i e  the number of stations  the second line of input will contain the integer k i e  the number of stations where wifi is supposed to be provided  the next n lines will contain the integers pi  the next n lines will contain the integers ci  tips  if you have multiple test cases in a file start this section as the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  dont write any constraints here use section constraints for this below  if for example the input of each test is an array you could write it like this the first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of      the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an denoting the        xa output the first line of output will contain space separated integers i i i    ik which are the serial numbers of the station where wifi will be provided  the serial numbers must start from  and end at n  print them in increasing order   constraints should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have  format it like   ≤ n ≤   ≤ k ≤ n  xa example input                        output    xa explanation example case   of the given list of  stations line  we need to install wifi at  of them line   refer the table above for simplicity  we find that on installing wifi at nagpur and rourkela we can serve wifi to  people on spending inr  for which the ratio is   the maximum for any  stations out of these ten  the serial no  of nagpur is  and that of rourkela is   hence the output    author abhirajphadnis editorial  codechef comproblemstrindia tags                                   abhirajphadnis greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
