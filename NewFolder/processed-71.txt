 our chef is hosting a cooking competition in which only two teams can compete at the same time  both sides should have an equal number of participants to make the competition engaging and fair  chef was given the duty of forming the two teams as an organizer  there are various conditions for forming teams  he will be assigned a number n for each competition and for each divisor d of n including  and n itself he will add a member  if d is even go to the first team   if d is odd go to the second team  chef needs your assistance with the event planning because he is quite busy  your job is to advise the chef whether or not he can make two teams with the same amount of members  for example for ‘n’   the divisors are      the first team will have two members corresponding to even divisors  and   the second team will have two members corresponding to odd divisors  and   so in this case chef can make two teams  input format  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow  the first and only line of each test case contains an integer ‘n’ denoting the number given to chef   output format for each test case print  if chef can make two teams of equal members with the given ‘n’ else print   output for each test case will be printed in a separate line  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  it is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn’t exceed   time limit  sec                          sample input                                                        sample output                              explanation in test case  n   the divisors of  are   the first team will have  members since there are no even divisors  the second team will have  members corresponding to divisors  and   since the teams have a different number of members the output will be   in test case  n the divisors of  are   the first team will have  members corresponding to divisors  and   the second team will have  members corresponding to divisors  and   since the teams have the same number of members the output will be                            sample input                                                        sample output                               author ★aniket editorial  codechef comproblemscrcteam tags                                   aniket array divisors operations                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
