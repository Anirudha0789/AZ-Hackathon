  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  tuzik is a little dog  but despite the fact he is still a puppy he already knows about the pretty things that coins are  he knows that for every coin he can get very tasty bone from his master  he believes that some day he will find a treasure and have loads of bones  and finally he found something interesting  a wooden chest containing n coins but as you should remember tuzik is just a little dog and so he cant open it by himself  actually the only thing he can really do is barking  he can use his barking to attract nearby people and seek their help  he can set the loudness of his barking very precisely and therefore you can assume that he can choose to call any number of people from a minimum of  to a maximum of k  when people come and open the chest they divide all the coins between them in such a way that everyone will get the same amount of coins and this amount is maximal possible  if some coins are not used they will leave it on the ground and tuzik will take them after they go away  since tuzik is clearly not a fool he understands that his profit depends on the number of people he will call  while tuzik works on his barking you have to find the maximum possible number of coins he can get  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  each of next t lines contains  spaceseparated integers n and k for this test case  output for each test case output one integer  the maximum possible number of coins tuzik can get  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n k ≤                          sample input                                                          sample output                              explanation in the first example he should call two people  each of them will take  coins and they will leave  coin for tuzik  in the second example he should call  people    author ★pavel tester ★zedthirtyeight editorial  codechef comproblemsgdog tags                                   basic maths implementation                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
