  after acquiring an extraordinary amount of knowledge through programming contests malvika decided to harness her expertise to train the next generation of indian programmers  so she decided to hold a programming camp  in the camp she held a discussion session for n members n students and herself  they are sitting in a line from left to right numbered through  to n  malvika is sitting in the nth spot  she wants to teach m topics of competitive programming to the students  as the people taking part in the camp are all newbies they know none of the topics being taught i e  initially the first n   people in the line know none of the topics while the nth knows all of them  it takes one hour for a person to learn a topic from his neighbour  obviously one person cannot both teach a topic as well as learn one during the same hour  that is in any particular hour a person can either teach a topic that he knows to one of his neighbors or he can learn a topic from one of his neighbors or he can sit idly  it is also obvious that if person x is learning from person y at a particular hour then person y must be teaching person x at that hour   also note that people can work parallely too i e  in the same hour when the th person is teaching the rd person the st person can also teach the nd or learn from nd  find out the minimum number of hours needed so that each person learns all the m topics   input  the first line of input contains a single integer t denoting number of test cases  the only line of each test case contains two space separated integers n m as defined in the statement   output  for each test case output a single integer in a line corresponding to the answer of the problem   constraints   ≤ t n m ≤   example input       output    explanation in the first example there are two people  second person is malvika and she has to teach only one topic to the first person  it will take only one hour to do so   in the second example there are three people  the rd person is malvika and she has to teach only two topics to st and nd person  in the st hour she teaches the st topic to the nd person  now in the nd hour the nd person will teach the st topic to the st person  in the rd hour malvika will teach the nd topic to the nd person  now the nd person will teach that topic to the st in the th hour  so it takes a total of  hours for all the people to know all the topics    author admin tags                                   basic maths greedy adhoc                                                              mathematics algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
