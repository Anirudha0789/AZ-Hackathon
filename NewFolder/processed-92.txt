 xa rahul has been given a new task  he has been given n points on the xaxis xx   xn  now he is being asked q queries  each query gives him his position on the xaxis x and asks him the sum of distances from his position and the n points  as the sum can be quite large he has been told to print the answer modulo   he has written a program to calculate every query but it seems to be giving him vague answers   help him      xa flawed code  include   define ll long long using namespace std int main     int nxq     cinnq     int anbnmod     forint iini         cinx         axbx     ll upd     forint iini         updaimodaiaiupdmod     upd     forint inii         updbimodbibiupdmod     whileqcinxprintflldaxbxmod input  the first line of the input contains two integers n denoting the number of points on xaxis q denoting number of queries  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers x x     xn denoting the points on xaxis   the next q lines contains a single integer x denoting the new position of rahul xa output  for each query output a single line containing the answer   xa constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ q ≤   ≤ xi x ≤   xa example input         output   xa  author ★vibhorgupta editorial  codechef comproblemschkdst tags                                   array flfi implementation medium mediumhard vibhorgupta                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyp  submit
