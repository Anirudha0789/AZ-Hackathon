  chef lives in chefland  chefland can be accurately represented by a certain number of intersections and the roads connecting them  chefland is a strange place because all the roads there are oneway  also for any two intersections a and b once you travel from a to b you can never return to a again because there is simply no route you can take to get back to a  unaware of this chef set out to visit his friend and now he cant return home so chef decides to travel to the townhall and complain about this ridiculous system  studying the map of chefland chef wonders about the number of ways in which he can travel to the townhall  help him find this number  as the number may be very large print it modulo    input the first line of the input contains  integers n and m  they are the number of intersections and number of roads in chefland respectively   the second line contains  integers p and q  p is the intersection where chef is currently located  q is the intersection where the townhall is located   m lines follow each containing a pair of integers a b  for each pair a b a road exists connecting intersection b to a along which one can travel from a to b only   output output a single line containing an integer which is the number of ways in which chef can travel from p to q modulo   constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ m ≤   ≤ p q ≤ n  ≤ a b ≤ n a  b   example input                  output   explanation possible paths chef can take are   and                                                                                       author ★subham editorial  codechef comproblemsclbf tags                                   colg dynamicprogramming graphs medium subham topologicalsort                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
