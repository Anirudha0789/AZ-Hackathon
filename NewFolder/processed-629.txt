  the little elephant from the zoo of lviv likes lucky digits  everybody knows that the lucky digits are digits  and   this time he has an array a that consists of n integers a a     an  let fx be the number of digits  in the decimal representation of x and fx be the number of digits  in the decimal representation of x  for example f   f   and f    consider some pair of integers l and r such that  ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n  let c be the total number of digits  in decimal representation of integers al al       ar i  e  c  fal  fal         far  similarly let c be the the total number of digits  in decimal representation of integers al al       ar i  e  c  fal  fal         far  the little elephant wants to know the number of such pairs l r for which cc ≤ r − l    but he believes that the number  is unlucky  hence he discards all pairs where c   or c    help the little elephant to find the answer for the problem  remark      it is a standard mathematical definition   input  the first line of the input contains a single integer t the number of test cases  then t test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains a single integer n the size of the array a for the corresponding test case  the second line contains n space separated integers a a     an   output  for each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case   constraints   ≤ t ≤    ≤ n ≤    ≤ ai ≤   example input             output     explanation  case   here c  c   for all pairs l r  so    ≤ r − l   for each pair  there are  pairs l r in all              so the answer is   case   here we have  pairs of l r in all  consider them all    l   r   c   c   cc     ≤   r − l    the pair is counted   l   r   c   c   cc     ≤   r − l    the pair is counted   l   r   c   c   cc     ≤   r − l    but the pair is not counted since c     l   r   c   c   cc        r − l    the pair is not counted   l   r   c   c   cc     ≤   r − l    the pair is counted   l   r   c   c   cc     ≤   r − l    the pair is counted   l   r   c   c   cc        r − l    the pair is not counted  it is also not counted since c   and also since c     l   r   c   c   cc     ≤   r − l    the pair is counted   l   r   c   c   cc        r − l    the pair is not counted  it is also not counted since c   and also since c     l   r   c   c   cc     ≤   r − l    but the pair is not counted since c     as we see there are exactly  pairs l r that satisfy required constraints  case   here we have the only pair l r    for which c   c   and cc     ≤   r − l    so it is counted and the answer is     author ★witaliyadm tags                                   binarysearch cook maths mediumhard witaliyadm                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
