 willow a  years old genius thought that sorting is based on the last digit of a number  his comparison process is if the last digit of an integer aa is smaller than the last digit of another integer bb then aabb  and if the last digit of two integers is same then he checks the previous one and this way the comparison continues  that means if the digits of an integer aa is represented as  aaaa…anan and another integer bb as  bbbb…bmbm n and m not necessary to be equal aa will be smaller than bb if there is an ii such that aiai  bibi and for each valid jj  ii ajaj  bjbj  for example  if aa  bb then aa  bb  if aa    bb   then aa  bb  willow is trying to sort nn numbers in ascending order in his process  can you help him input format  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   first line of each testcase contains of a single line of input one integer nn  number of integers   then nn line contains nn integers xxxx…xnxn  output format for pth testcase first line will be case pdont put a space after this statement or it may cause wa and then print the numbers in n line after sorting by willows rule  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤xi≤≤xi≤                         sample input                                                         sample output                            case      author ★samia editorial  codechef comproblemswisort tags                                   samia sorting strings                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
