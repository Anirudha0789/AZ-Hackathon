 read problem statements in mandarin vietnamese and russian as well  you are given a positive integer kk and an array aa consisting of nn nonnegative integers  find the lexicographically smallest sequence bb that satisfies the following conditions  we can obtain bb by rearranging the elements in aa  the length of longest nondecreasing subsequence of bb is equal to kk   if no such sequence exists print −−  input format  first line of the input contains tt the number of testcases  then the testcases follow  first line of each test case contains two space separated integers nn and kk  second line of each test case contains nn space separated integers describing the array aa   output format for each test case output the array bb in a single line with a space between two consecutive elements  and output −− if no such array bb exists  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤n≤k≤n ≤ai≤n≤ai≤n sum of nn over all test cases doesnt exceed                           sample input                                                                          sample output                                      explanation there are  arrays that are rearrangements of the array     with length of longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to    with length of longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to    with length of longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to    with length of longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to    with length of longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to    with length of longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to    test case  observe from the list above that  is the only rearrangement of  with the length of the longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to   and hence  is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions  test case  observe from the above list the  is the lexicographically smallest among all those rearrangements with the length of the longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to   and hence  is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions  test case  observe from the list above that  is the only rearrangement of  with the length of the longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to   and hence  is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions  test case  there are only  possible ways to rearrange     with length of longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to    with length of longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to    with length of longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to    so there does not exist any rearrangement of  with the length of the longest nondecreasing subsequence equal to    author suryaprakadm editorial  codechef comproblemsdecsubk tags                                   longest increasing subsequence greedy sorting brute force                                                              algorithms dynamic programming dp on sequences                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
