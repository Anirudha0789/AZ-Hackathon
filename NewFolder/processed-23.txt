 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given a matrix of integers aa with nn rows numbered  through nn and mm columns numbered  through mm  each element of this matrix is either  or   a move consists of the following steps  choose two different rows rr and rr or two different columns cc and cc  apply the bitwise or operation with the second rowcolumn on the first rowcolumn  formally if you chose two rows this means you should change arkark to ark∨arkark∨ark for each ≤k≤m≤k≤m if you chose two columns then you should change akcakc to akc∨akcakc∨akc for each ≤k≤n≤k≤n   for each element of the matrix compute the minimum number of moves required to make it equal to  or determine that it is impossible  note that these answers are independent i e  we are starting with the initial matrix for each of them  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm  nn lines follow  for each ii ≤i≤n≤i≤n the iith of these lines contains mm integers aiai…aimaiai…aim not separated by spaces   output for each test case print nn lines  for each valid ii the iith of these lines should contain mm spaceseparated integers for each valid jj the jjth of these integers should be the minimum number of moves required to make aijaij equal to  or −− if it is impossible  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nm≤≤nm≤ aij∈aij∈ for each valid ijij the sum of n⋅mn⋅m for all test cases does not exceed                          sample input                                                           sample output                                      author ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemsormatrix tags                                   d arrays bitwise operation observation implementation                                                              data structures arrays mathematics bit manipulation algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
