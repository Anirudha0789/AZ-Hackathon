 shahid is a computer science student and his teacher gave him a simple question to solve within time but he is little busy in his life so he asked you to solve this problem  problem statement  you have been given an array of positive integers  aa   an with legnth n and you have to print an array of same legnthn where the values in the new array are the sum of every number in the array except the number at that index   input  the first line of input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  each test cases contain two lines first line contains n the length of the array and second line contains n space separated positive integers   output  for each test case output a single array of same length   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ai   example input                output           explanation test case  for the first index the result will be   similarly for the second third and fourth index the corresponding results will be   and  respectively   author ★dshahid editorial  codechef comproblemsarrprob tags                                   array dshahid dshahid encoding horsbug                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
