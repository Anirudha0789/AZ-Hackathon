 with this jump you move further in time and land inside the nasa national aeronautics and space administration  the ways of time are completely bizarre  you hear the same laugh which pushed you in this machine and you turn to find the mad scientist prof paradox  he laughs telling you that you have entered doomsday and that the whole homosapien species ends that day  though shocked you are determined to stop this whatever it might be  prof paradox is a part of the asteroid impact avoidance committee aiac in nasa and he informs you that nn asteroids with varying sizes are approaching earth and if left unattended it will end life on earth as we know it  fortunately you have kk nuclear plasma blasters that can destroy an asteroid  the cost of each blast is determined by the size of the asteroid  however after each blast the cost required increases   if xx is the number of blasts already fired by a blaster bibi then the cost of the next blast in the blaster bibi is x∗sx∗s where ss is the size of the asteroid  you are free to use any number of the available kk blasters   can you avoid this collision course by finding the minimum cost required to save our planet since the results can be large output result modulo    input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   first line of each testcase contains of a single line of input two integers nknk  second line of each testcase contains nn spaced integers denoting the size of the asteroid    output for each testcase output in a single line the minimum cost required to destroy all the asteroids modulo   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤n≤k≤n ≤sizeofeachasteroid≤≤sizeofeachasteroid≤  subtasks   points  ≤nk≤≤nk≤  points  original constraints  sample input                  sample output     explanation  we have  plasma blasters                                                                      stst and ndnd asteroid can be shot by blaster  cost∗∗∗∗ rdrd and thth asteroid can be shot by blaster  cost∗∗∗∗ thth asteroid can be shot by blaster  cost∗∗ therefore total cost      it can be verified that any other possible combination results in a larger cost   author ★dharsanr editorial  codechef comproblemsastr tags                                   dharsanr greedy heli                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
