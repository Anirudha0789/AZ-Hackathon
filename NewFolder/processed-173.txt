 an input string ss of length nn is transferred through the network using a special protocol  the protocol can send the string through a series of operations  in one operation we can choose a lowercase english alphabet cc and do one of the following  transfer  copy of cc through the network  transfer  copies of cc through the network   each of the above transfers take  unit of time  find the minimum time in which we can transfer the entire string ss through the network  input format  the first line will contain tt  the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  first line of each test case contains nn  the length of the string ss   second line of each test case contains the string ss   output format for each test case output in a single line the minimum time required to transfer the string   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed    string ss contains lowercase english alphabets only                          sample input                              cbcdc  aabeee                          sample output                              explanation test case  string can be transferred through following operations send  copy of character cc send  copy of character bb send  copy of character cc send  copy of character dd and send  copy of character cc  thus total  operations are required   test case  string can be transferred through following operations send  copies of character aa send  copy of character bb send  copy of character ee and send  copies of character ee  thus total  operations are required    author ★sg editorial  codechef comproblemsstrp tags                                   cakewalk greedy sg start strings                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
