 chef is playing with balls of two colours one red and another green there is a machine named chef game machine in which all the balls are kept  chef game machine is having a button which when press it shuffles and puts all the balls in a rownumbered from  to n one row will contain only one ball lets denote red ball with  and green ball with   game is that one need to find the maximum contiguous length of red balls by replacing at most one green ball in the row after shuffling  chef can win the game if he finds the correct length of contiguous red balls by replacing at most one green ball for example after shuffling the arrangement of ball is like this            if you replace green ball at th place by red ball then you will get            here maximun contiguous red ball length is from index  to index        now chef wants to win every time so he ask you to find the longest contiguous  red balls length after replacing one green ball the row    note  you may or may not replace green ball    input     first line of test case will contains t number of test cases  t lines follows    first line of every test case will contain the length n of the row    second line will contains n space separated s and s      output     output will print a single integer denoting the maximum contiguous length possible after replacing on green ball   constraints    ≤t≤≤t≤  ≤n≤≤n≤   ≤ai≤≤ai≤  sample input             sample output  t t                                                                                     author ★dshahid editorial  codechef comproblemsmdsb tags                                   array dshahid easy enja                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
