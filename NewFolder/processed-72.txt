 numeros the artist had two lists that were permutations of one another  he was very proud  unfortunately while transporting them from one exhibition to another some numbers were lost out of the first list  can you find the missing numbers as an example the array with some numbers missing arrarr  the original array of numbers brrbrr  the numbers missing are   notes  if a number occurs multiple times in the lists you must ensure that the frequency of that number in both lists is the same  if that is not the case then it is also a missing number  you have to print all the missing numbers in ascending order  print each missing number once even if it is missing multiple times  the difference between the maximum and minimum number in the second list is less than or equal to   arr the array with missing numbers brr the original array of numbers  input there will be four lines of input  nn the size of the first list arrarr  the next line contains  nn spaceseparated integers arriarri  mm the size of the second list brrbrr  the next line contains  mm spaceseparated integers brribrri   output output the missing numbers in ascending order separated by space  constraints  ≤nm≤≤nm≤ x  n≤mn≤m ≤brri≤≤brri≤ xxmax  xxmin ≤≤  sample input                          sample output    explanation  is present in both arrays  its frequency in  arrarr is  while its frequency in brrbrr  is   similarly   and   occur twice in arrarr but three times in brrbrr  the rest of the numbers have the same frequencies in both lists   author ★ayush editorial  codechef comproblemsfinlot tags                                   array ayush easymedium                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
