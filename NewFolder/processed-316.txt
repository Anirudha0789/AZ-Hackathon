  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  after learning to solve maximum sum subarray problem its time for you to solve the maximum product subsequence  youre given an array of n integers and a number k   the maximum kproduct of the array is the maximum product of any k length subsequence of the array  for example the maximum product of the array      is  because the product of the subsequence   is  and it is impossible to achieve larger subsequence product  what is the maximum kproduct you can achieve since the answer can be very large output it modulo     note  recall that the result of a modulo operation is always nonnegative  for example  mod      input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two space separated integers n and k  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an denoting the elements of the array   output for each test case output a single line containing the maximum kproduct of the array  constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ k ≤ n ≤   ≤ ai ≤  the sum of the ns over all the test cases in a single test file is ≤ ×  example input                        output      explanation example case   the maximum product of the array     is  and is achieved by the subsequence    example case   the maximum product of the array     is  and is achieved by the subsequence    example case   the maximum product of the array    is  and is achieved by the subsequence   modulo    this is   example case   the maximum product of the array   is  and is achieved by the subsequence   modulo    this is   the reason why  mod      is that for positive m a mod m is defined as the smallest nonnegative integer b such that a  b is divisible by m   author ★kevinsogo tester ★kevinsogo editorial  codechef comproblemsmmprod tags                                   greedy sorting                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
