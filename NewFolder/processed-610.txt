  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well   you are given a rooted tree of n vertices the root is at vertex   the ith edge has two parameters associated with it ci denoting the cost of the edge and parameter di  you want to make cost of all the paths from the root to any leaf having equal costs  cost of a path is sum of costs of all the edges on the path  for that you can increase or decrease cost of any edge  the time taken in changing cost of ith edge to x will be di × x  ci  find the minimum time required to make cost of all the paths from the root to all leaves equal  furthmore you should also output the new edge costs  if there are more than one possible solutions you can print any of them  note that you can change costs of edges to negative but all costs should be integers   input first line of input contains an integer t denoting number of test cases  t test cases follow  first line of each test case contains an integer n denoting number of vertices in the tree  each of the next n   line contains four space separated integers ui vi ci di denoting there is an edge between vertex ui and vi with parameters ci and di that are described in the statement  output for each test case output n lines  first line should contain an integer corresponding to minimum time required  in next n   lines ith line should contain the updated cost of ith edge  constraints   ≤ t n ≤  denote the sum of n in all t testcases with s s ≤   ≤ ui vi ≤ n  ≤ ci di ≤   subtasks  subtask   points s ≤  all nodes except node  are direct children of node  subtask   points s ≤  subtask   points di   for all i subtask   points original constraints  example input                    output        author ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemstreebal tags                                   trees treap dp on trees dfs binary search                                                              data structures graphs advanced data structures advanced algorithms advanced dp algorithms graph algos traversals searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
