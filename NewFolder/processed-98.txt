 alice gives bob two integers a and n  alice defines a series as follows starting with a next term in series is square of previous term i e  tntn−tntn− tata since nthnth term could be very large therefore she asks bob to tell the unit digit of nthnth term  bob is currently busy with his homework can you solve this for him  input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   each testcase contains of a single line of input two integers anan    output for each testcase output in a single line answer unit digit of nthnth term  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤a≤≤a≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  subtasks subtask   points  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  subtask   points original constraints  sample input     sample output   explanation series will be  and unit digit of ndnd term is    author pecchapter editorial  codechef comproblemsttd tags                                   array math observation pecchapter                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
