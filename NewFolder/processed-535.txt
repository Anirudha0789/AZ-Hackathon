 chef is an algorithmist so his friend has given him a problem   problem is that you have been given an array aindexed  through n  there is a thresold value thth  you need to find a maximum integer value m so that ss is greater or equal to thth     where     ss  ∑nimaxai−m∑inmaxai−m       for example   if aa is  and thth then mm will be  and   smax−max−max−max−max−max−max−smax−max−max−max−max−max−max−     i e ss which greater than thth  chef is very busy with his internship so he ask you to do this for him  you need to print maximum value mm as well as ss    input     first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow    each testcase contains of a single line of input two integers nthnth   third line will contains aaa          anaaa          an    output  for each testcase output two space separated integers mm and ss    constraints    ≤t≤≤t≤  ≤n≤≤n≤  ≤th≤≤th≤   ≤ai≤≤ai≤  sample input  t  t                                               sample output                                         author ★dshahid editorial  codechef comproblemsmdsa tags                                   binarysearch dshahid easy enja                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
