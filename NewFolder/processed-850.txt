 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese russian vietnamese and bengali as well  roger recently built a circular race track with length kk  after hosting a few races he realised that people do not come there to see the race itself they come to see racers crash into each other whats wrong with our generation…  after this realisation roger decided to hold a different kind of races he hired nn racers numbered  through nn whose task is to crash into each other  at the beginning for each valid ii the iith racer is xixi metres away from the starting point of the track measured in the clockwise direction and driving in the direction didi clockwise or counterclockwise  all racers move with the constant speed  metre per second  the lengths of cars are negligible but the track is only wide enough for one car so whenever two cars have the same position along the track they crash into each other and the direction of movement of each of these cars changes from clockwise to counterclockwise and vice versa  the cars do not change the directions of their movement otherwise  since crashes reduce the lifetime of the racing cars roger sometimes wonders how many crashes happen  you should answer qq queries  in each query you are given an integer tt and you should find the number of crashes that happen until tt seconds have passed inclusive  input  the first line of the input contains three spaceseparated integers nn qq and kk  nn lines follow  for each ii ≤i≤n≤i≤n the iith of these lines contains two spaceseparated integers didi and xixi where didi and didi denote the clockwise and counterclockwise directions respectively  each of the next qq lines contain a single integer tt describing a query   output for each query print a single line containing one integer — the number of crashes  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤q≤≤q≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ≤di≤≤di≤ for each valid ii ≤xi≤k−≤xi≤k− for each valid ii xx…xnxx…xn are pairwise distinct ≤t≤≤t≤                         sample input                                                                     sample output                                author ★kmaaszraa editorial  codechef comproblemscrshit tags                                   cook easymedium kmaaszraa kmaaszraa sorting twopointers                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
