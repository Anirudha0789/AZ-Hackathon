 mr  vasu being one of the top coders in his college was given the responsibility to organize a coding contest for nit kurukshetra’s tech festival  although he was very good at solving questions he found that it was a much harder task to make questions  the contest’s date was coming close and he couldn’t come up with any problems  finally mr  vasu decides to copy questions from a website to make the contest not a decision he was very proud of  the website has nn number of questions  each of the questions has a difficulty rating associated with it  the ith question has a difficulty didi  you are given a list of the difficulty rating of all the questions  vasu has to select qq questions out of them ≤q≤n≤q≤n  he wants the minimum rating difference between any two questions out of all the questions that he selected should be maximized  input  the first line contains a single integer nn denoting the number of questions the second line contains qq which denotes the number of questions vasu has to pick  the third line contains nn spaceseparated integers in ascending order denoting the difficulty rating of the question   output print the largest minimum rating difference between any two questions selected by vasu  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤q≤n≤q≤n ≤di≤≤di≤  sample input          sample output   explanation vasu can select the questions with difficulty rating   and  resulting in a minimum rating difference of    author ★vasu editorial  codechef comproblemsencd tags                                   binarysearch dynamicprogramming enco vasu                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
