  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  russian and vietnamese as well  akhil has many balls of white and black colors  one day he was playing with them  during the play he arranged the balls into two rows both consisting of n number of balls  these two rows of balls are given to you in the form of strings x y  both these string consist of w and b where w denotes a white colored ball and b a black colored   other than these two rows of balls akhil has an infinite supply of extra balls of each color  he wants to create another row of n balls z in such a way that the sum of hamming distance between x and z and hamming distance between y and z is maximized  hamming distance between two strings x and y is defined as the number of positions where the color of balls in row x differs from the row y ball at that position  e g  hamming distance between wbb bwb is  as at position  and  corresponding colors in the two strings differ    as there can be multiple such arrangements of row z akhil wants you to find the lexicographically smallest arrangement which will maximize the above value    input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows first line of each test case will contain a string x denoting the arrangement of balls in first row second line will contain the string y denoting the arrangement of balls in second row  output for each test case output a single line containing the string of length n denoting the arrangement of colors of the balls belonging to row z  constraints  ≤ t ≤  subtasks subtask   points   ≤ n ≤  subtask   points   ≤ n ≤  subtask   points   ≤ n ≤                           sample input                             wbwb wbbb                          sample output                            bwbw explanation example case   as we know hamming distancewbwb bwbw  hamming distancewbbb bwbw        you can try any other value for string z it will never exceed     author ★amitpandeykgp tester ★prateekg editorial  codechef comproblemsacball tags                                   string hamming distance greedy adhoc                                                              data structures mathematics error detection algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
