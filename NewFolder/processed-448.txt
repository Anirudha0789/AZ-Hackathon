 steve is in a fight with hydra  he has nn gun shots  he has to kill the enemy in order to rule their territory  but he can only fire  or  shots at each move  he also wants the number of moves to be a multiple of an integer kk otherwise the gun will explode  help steve to find the minimal number of moves to win the battle against hydra by following the conditions given   input first line contains tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow  each testcase contains two space separated integers nn kk   note input file can be empty  output for each testcase output an integer i e  minimal number of moves being a multiple of kk  if there is no way he can win the battle by following the condition print u−−   constraints ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤  subtasks subtask  points original constraints  sample input       sample output    explanation for the first case steve could win the battle in  moves with following sequence of steps         for the second test there are only three valid sequence of steps        with   and  steps respectively  all these numbers are not multiples of    author pecchapter editorial  codechef comproblemsstag tags                                   greedy implementation math pecchapter                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
