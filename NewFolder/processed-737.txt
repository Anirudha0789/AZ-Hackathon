  read problems statements in mandarin chinese and russian as well  problem description you will be given a zeroindexed array a  you need to rearrange its elements in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied  ai ≤ ai if i is even  ai ≥ ai if i is odd  in other words the following inequality should hold a ≤ a ≥ a ≤ a ≥ a and so on  operations ≤ and ≥ should alter   input the first line contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the first line of each test case contains an integer n that is the size of the array a  the second line of each test case contains the elements of array a output for each test case output a single line containing n space separated integers which are the elements of a arranged in the required order  if there are more than one valid arrangements you can output any of them  constraints  ≤ n ≤  sum of n in one test file ≤   ≤ ai ≤                          sample input                                                             sample output                                 explanation example case  a  a is satisfied    example case  a  a is satisfied    a  a is satisfied    note    is also valid answer   author ★anudeep editorial  codechef comproblemsanuund tags                                   adhoc anudeep cook easy sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
