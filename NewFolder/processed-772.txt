 you are given an array aa containing nn integers  a subsequence of this array is called good if all the elements of this subsequence are distinct  find the number of good nonempty subsequences of aa  this number can be large so report it modulo   note that two subsequences are considered different if they differ in the indices chosen  for example in the array  there are  different nonempty subsequences  the first element  the second element and   out of these three subsequences the first two are good and the third is not  input format  the first line contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn denoting the number of elements in aa  the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an   output format for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the number of good subsequences modulo  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed                           sample input                                                            sample output                              explanation  test case  explained in the problem statement  test case  there are  nonempty subsequences   and   all three subsequences are good    author ★lavish editorial  codechef comproblemsdistele tags                                   d arrays maps hashmaps modular arithmetic basic maths sorting                                                              data structures arrays mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
