 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  consider a sequence of positive integers a  a a      an and another sequence b  b b      bm  we say that b is a subsequence of a if b can be written as ai ai      aim where  ≤ i  i      im ≤ n  if b is a subsequence of a there could be multiple ways to write it in such a manner and among all those ways we choose the way which minimizes im  we call this minimized im to be fb  note that in the definition of fb we are assuming that a is a constant  also when b is the empty sequence it is considered to be a subsequence of a and fb would then be   now given a we will construct a graph g which has n   nodes and labeled directed edges  the nodes are v v     vn  if there are two subsequences of a c and c such that c is obtained by appending the integer b at the end of c and fc ≠ fc then the edge  vfc b vfc  is added to the graph g if it is not already present in the graph  note that even if an edge with a different label is already present this edge is added  just that there will not be multiple edges from one vertex to another with the same label  the edge vi b vj means that it is a directed edge from vi to vj and it has the label b  chef constructed this graph but then lost the sequence a as well as all the labels on the graph  so all he has left is a directed graph with possibly multiple edges from one vertex to another and now he wants to find the sequence a  since there could be many such sequences which fit the graph he wants to find the lexicographically smallest such sequence  help chef in finding this  input  the first line contains a single integer t which is the number of testcases  the description of each testcase follows  the first line of each testcase contains two integers n and m  this means that the input graph has vertices v v     vn and m directed multiedges  the ith of the next m lines contains two integers xi and yi which denote that there is a directed edge from vxi to vyi   output for each testcase output a single line which contains n positive integers which denote the lexicographically smallest sequence which can lead to the construction of the inputted graph  or if such a sequence does not exist output   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n m ≤   ≤ xi yi ≤ n  subtasks  subtask   points  n m ≤   subtask   points  original constraints                         sample input                                                                                        sample output                                  explanation testcase  let us consider the sequence a        fempty string   and f       can be obtained by appending  to the empty string  hence there should be an edge from v to v with the label   similarly f       and f         hence there should be an edge from v to v with label   by looking at all such possible pairs of valid subsequences we can see that the edges obtained from this a exactly match the edges given in the input graph  and this is the lexicographically smallest such sequence  hence the answer is this sequence  testcase  there is no sequence which leads to the construction of this graph  hence the answer is    author admin editorial  codechef comproblemsstringra tags                                   greedy dag algos sorting                                                              algorithms graph algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
