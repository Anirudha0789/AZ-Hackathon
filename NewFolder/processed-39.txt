 an operation on an array of size nn shifts each of the arrays elements  unit to the left  for example if   operations are performed on array  then the array would become      given an array of nn integers and a number dd perform dd operations on the array  then print the updated array as a single line of spaceseparated integers   input format the    first   line    contains    two spaceseparated integers denoting the respective values of nn the number of integers and dd the number of operations you must perform   the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers describing the respective elements of the arrays initial state   constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤  ≤d≤n≤d≤n  ≤ai≤≤ai≤ where aiai is the ith element of array     output format print a single    line    of nn spaceseparated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing dd operations   sample input           sample output      explanation when we perform dd operations the array undergoes the following sequence of changes    →→→→→→→→  thus we print the arrays final state as a single line of spaceseparated    values which is        author ★ayush editorial  codechef comproblemslefrot tags                                   array ayush coco simple                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit    secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs pypy nodejs php go hask lua js d fort fs erl cob  submit
