 read problems statements in russian and vietnamese as well  chef and hasan went for skiing in a rectangular field the field can be represented as a grid of n rows and m columns rows are numbered from  to n starting from top columns are numbered from  to m starting from left each cell has a a number representing the height of the snow on this particular part of the field   after skiing for a while in the field they decided to play a game  first hasan has to choose a set of cells s not necessarily adjacent and show this set to chef  after that chef has to choose exactly one cell d not necessarily from set s and tell it to hasan  finally hasan has to choose one cell from set s and start skiing from that cell and try to reach cell d that the chef just chose if he couldnt then chef wins otherwise hasan wins   when hasan is skiing he can move from one cell to another iff both cells are adjacent they share a side and the height of destination cell is not more than the height of current cell    its obvious that its easy for hasan to win this game because he can simply choose all cells to be in set s but he want the set s to have minimum number of cells to prove that he is very skilled in skiing   knowing that both players play optimally please help hasan to find minimum number of cells to be in set s to guarantee the winning for him   xa input first line contains integer t donating the number of testcases  first line of each testcase contains two integers n and m donating the number of rows and columns respectively  each of the following n lines contains m numbers donating the heights of the field output for each testcase output a single line containing a single integer donating minimum number of cells has to be in set s so that hasan guarantee winning  constraints should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have  format it like   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n m ≤   ≤ sum of n in all testcases ≤   ≤ sum of m in all testcases ≤   ≤ height of snow ≤   xa                          sample input                                                                            sample output                              explanation example case   hasan has to select at least two cells to be in s so that he guarantee he can reach all other cells starting from anyone of them example of cells to choose  and  example case   if hasan chose cell  to be in s then he can reach any cell starting from it and thus guarantee winning  author ★kingofnumbers tester ★amrmahmoud editorial  codechef comproblemsskiing tags                                   directed graphs greedy strongly connected components dfs bfs sorting                                                              data structures graphs algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
