 xa poornima college is having n branches where each branches have positive integral student  a minimize operation is performed on the branch such that all of them are reduced by the minimum number student in a branch  suppose we have  branches and all of them have below students in a branch       then in one minimize operation we reduce all the branch by  students  for next minimize operation  branch are left have nonzero student whose value are      above step is repeated till no students are left in all branches   given students of n branches print the number of student that are reduce in subsequent minimize operation  xa input the first line contains a single integer n   the next line contains n integers  x x x      xn separated by space where xi represents the student of ith branch   output  for each minimize operation print the number of students that are reduced in branches in separate line   constraints should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have  format it like    n     xi    xa  author â˜…dvlprexpert tags                                   array dvlprexpert maths medium                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
