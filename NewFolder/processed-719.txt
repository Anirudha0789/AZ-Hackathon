 read problem statements in bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given a graph gg with nn vertices numbered  through nn and mm edges  you should partition the vertices of gg into two sets aa and bb such that  each vertex of gg belongs to exactly one of these sets aa is nonempty aa is an independent set in gg i e  for each pair of vertices uv∈auv∈a gg does not contain an edge uvuv for each vertex a∈aa∈a and each vertex b∈bb∈b there is an edge abab in gg  find the number of such partitions abab  also give an example of one of these partitions or determine that no such partition exists  two partitions are considered different if there is a vertex that is in the set aa in one partition and in the set bb in the other partition  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm  each of the next mm lines contains two spaceseparated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge   output for each test case print two lines   the first of these lines should contain a single integer — the number of partitions satisfying the given conditions  the second line should contain a single string with length nn  if there are no partitions satisfying the given conditions each character of this string should be   otherwise this string should describe one such partition — for each valid ii the iith character should be  if vertex ii belongs to aa or  if it belongs to bb   constraints  ≤t≤⋅≤t≤⋅ ≤nm≤⋅≤nm≤⋅ ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n there are no selfloops or duplicate edges in the graph the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅ the sum of mm over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅  subtasks subtask   points nmt≤nmt≤ subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                      sample output                              explanation example case  the only possible partition satisfying the given conditions is abab   author ★pshishod editorial  codechef comproblemsindep tags                                   graph algos constructive                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
