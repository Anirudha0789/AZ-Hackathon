 sardar singh has many men fighting for him and he would like to calculate the power of each of them to better plan for his fight against ramadhir  the power of a string ss of lowercase english alphabets is defined to be  ∑isi⋅ordsi∑isi⋅ordsi where ordsiordsi is the position of sisi in the alphabet i e ord′a′ord′b′…ord′z′ord′a′ord′b′…ord′z′  each of sardar singhs men has a name consisting of lowercase english alphabets  the power of a man is defined to be the maximum power over all possible rearrangements of this string  find the power of each of sardar singhs men  input format  the first line of input contains an integer tt denoting the total number of sardar singhs men  each of the next tt lines contains a single string sisi the name of sardar singhs iith man   output format  output tt lines each containing a single integer  the iith of these lines should have the power of the iith of sardar singhs men   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤si≤≤si≤  sisi consists of lowercase english alphabets only                          sample input                             faizal                          sample output                             explanation the rearrangement with maximum power is aafilzaafilz  its power can be calculated as ⋅ord′a′⋅ord′a′⋅ord′f′⋅ord′i′⋅ord′l′⋅ord′z′⋅ord′a′⋅ord′a′⋅ord′f′⋅ord′i′⋅ord′l′⋅ord′z′ which equals   it can be verified that no rearrangement gives a larger power   author ★anshg editorial  codechef comproblemscalpower tags                                   string                                                              data structures                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
