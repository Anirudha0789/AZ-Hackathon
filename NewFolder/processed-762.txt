 problem description  chaitya is a great problem solver  he found that most of his problems could be solved by arranging them in a particular order  the problem input consists of n  numbers smaller than or equal to m  chaitya’s analysis consists of sorting this sequence according to their occurrences  the output must be sorted so that for two numbers a and b a will appear before b if the number of times a appears in the original order is larger than the number of times b does  if the number of occurrences is equal the number whose value appears sooner in the input should appear sooner in the sorted sequence  help chaitya by creating a custom sorting tool  input first line of input contains two integers n length of message and m the number from task description  next line contains n integers smaller than or equal to m   output output should contain n numbers in the required sequence  constraints  ≤ n  ≤   ≤ m ≤   example   input          output        example   input        output      author ★vedipen editorial  codechef comproblemskjcp tags                                   binarysearchtree kcpr map pairing sorting standardtemplatelibrary vector vedipen                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyp  submit
