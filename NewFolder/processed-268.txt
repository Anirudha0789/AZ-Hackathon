  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  lumpy is a bus driver  today the conductor is absent so lumpy has to do the conductors job as well  there are n creatures in the bus  sometimes the creatures dont carry change and cant pay the exact amount of the fare  each creature in the bus today has paid an amount greater than hisher fare  you are given information about the extra amount paid by each creature by an array a of size n where ai denotes the extra amount paid by the ith creature in rupees  after the end of the trip lumpy noticed that he had p one rupee coins and q two rupee coins  he wants to pay back the creatures using this money  being a kind hearted moose lumpy wants to pay back as many creatures as he can  note that lumpy will  not pay back the ith creature if he cant pay the exact amount that the ith creature requires with the coins that he possesses   lumpy is busy driving the bus and doesnt want to calculate the maximum number of creatures he can satisfy  he will surely cause an accident if he tries to do so  can you help him out with this task  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  for each test case first line consists of three space separated integers n p and q  second line consists of n space separated integers a containing n space integers where ith integer denotes ai  output for each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to maximum number of creatures that lumpy can pay back  constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ ai ≤   ≤ p q ≤  sum of n over all the cases does not exceed  subtasks subtask   points p   subtask   points q   subtask   points original constraints                         sample input                                                                         sample output                               explanation  example   lumpy has just  one rupee coins   he can pay creatures numbered   or creatures numbered   with these coins  thus answer is     example   lumpy has  one rupee coins and  two rupee coin   in the optimal solution lumpy can give the two rupee coin to creature  and the one rupee coins to creatures  and   thus answer is     author admin tester ★pushkarmishra editorial  codechef comproblemslumpybus tags                                   sorting                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
