 there is a circular track of length mm consisting of mm checkpoints and mm bidirectional roads such that each road has a length of  unit   chef is currently at checkpoint aa and wants to reach checkpoint bb  find the minimum length of the road he needs to travel  input format  first line will contain tt the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  each test case contains a single line of input three integers abab and mm  the initial checkpoint the final checkpoint and the total number of checkpoints respectively   output format for each test case output the minimum length chef needs to travel  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤ab≤m≤ab≤m a≠ba≠b                         sample input                                                                  sample output                                explanation test case  chef can go from  to  as →→ and then →→  thus total length travelled is  units  test case  chef can go from  to  as ←←←←←←  thus minimum distance travelled is  units  test case  chef can go from  to  as ←←←⋯←←←←←⋯←←  thus minimum distance travelled is  units  test case  chef can go from  to  as ←←  thus minimum distance travelled is  unit   author utkarshadm editorial  codechef comproblemsloop tags                                   basic maths implementation                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
