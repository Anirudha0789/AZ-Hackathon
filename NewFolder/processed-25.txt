 a beautiful sequence is defined as a sequence that do not have any repeating elements in it  you will be given any random sequence of integers and you have to tell whether it is a beautiful sequence or not   input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt  tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases is as follows  the next line of the input contains a single integer nn  nn denotes the total number of elements in the sequence  the next line of the input contains nn spaceseparated integers aaa   anaaa   an denoting the sequence   output  print prekrasnyywithout quotes if the given sequence is a beautiful sequence else print ne krasivowithout quotes  note each test case output must be printed on new line constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤aaa   an≤≤aaa   an≤  sample input               sample output prekrasnyy ne krasivo  explanation  as st sequence do not have any elements repeating hence it is a beautiful sequence as in nd sequence the element  is repeated twice hence it is not a beautiful sequence   author proarmy editorial  codechef comproblemsfreqarry tags                                   array arys easy proarmy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
