 permutation p is an ordered set of integers p puu    pn consisting of n distinct positive integers each of them doesnt exceed n  well denote the ith element of permutation p as pi  well call number n the size or the length of permutation p puu    pn  you have a sequence of integers a auu    an  in one move you are allowed to decrease or increase any number by one  count the minimum number of moves needed to build a permutation from this sequence  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains an integer  n — the size of the sought permutation  the second line of each test case contains n space separated integers a auu    an  output for each test case print a single number — the minimum number of moves   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ ai ≤   example input         output    explanation example case    you should decrease the first number by one and then increase the second number by one  the resulting permutation is u  example case    you need  moves to build permutation uu   author ★puneetguptaa editorial  codechef comproblemscdx tags                                   easy greedy implementation puneetguptaa sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
