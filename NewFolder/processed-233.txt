 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef and chefu are at a magical candy store playing a game with the following rules  there are two candy counters each of them stores an infinite number of candies  at any time only one of the counters is open and the other is closed  exactly one player is present at each of the counters  initially chef is at the open counter and chefu is at the closed counter  there is a sequence of nn distinct integers aa…anaa…an  the game consists of rr turns in the iith turn the open counter offers only cai−ncai−n candies to the player present at this counter  this player should choose a positive number of candies mm to accept where ≤m≤c≤m≤c  if this player accepts an odd number of candies the players have to swap their positions each player goes to the other counter  after each nn turns the counter which was currently open is closed and the counter which was currently closed is opened  the primary goal of each player is to maximise his own number of candies after rr turns  as a second priority each player wants to minimise the number of candies his opponent has after rr turns   you should process qq queries  in each query you are given rr and you should find the number of candies chef has after rr turns assuming that both players play the game optimally  since this number could be very large compute it modulo   input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an  the third line contains a single integer qq  each of the next qq lines contains a single integer rr describing a query   output for each query print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of candies chef can get modulo   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for each valid ii aa…anaa…an are pairwise distinct ≤q≤≤q≤ ≤r≤≤r≤ the sum of nqnq over all test cases does not exceed   subtasks subtask   points  n≤n≤ q≤q≤ r≤r≤  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                              sample output                              explanation example case  in the st nd and rd turn chef takes   and  candies  in total respectively  in the th turn chef takes  candy  in total this is the answer to the first query which is odd and hence he has to go to the counter which is closed  however since nn turns are just completed the counter which was currently open closes and the other one where chef went opens  in the th round chef can take  candies so he has  candies   author ★utkarsh editorial  codechef comproblemscndygame tags                                   game theory prefix sum                                                              algorithms simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
