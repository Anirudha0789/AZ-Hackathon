 you are given a binary string ss of length nn i e  every character of ss is either  or   you can perform the following operation on ss  select any two indices ijij of the same parity i e  either both ijij are odd or both ijij are even swap sisi and sjsj  for example in the string  we can swap the second and the fourth characters to get   however we can never obtain  from  by performing such swaps  find the maximum possible number of occurrences of the string  as a substring of ss after performing the above operation any number of times it is also allowed to not perform any operation  for example the string  has no occurrence of the string  as a substring whereas we can swap the second and fourth characters to obtain  which has exactly one occurrence of  colored red  input format  the first line of input contains an integer tt denoting the number of testcases  the description of the tt testcases follow  each testcase consists of two lines  the first line contains a single integer nn the length of the string ss  the second line contains a binary string of length nn   output format  for each testcase print in a single line an integer — the answer as per the problem statement   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤s≤≤s≤ the sum of ss over all testcases doesnt exceed   subtasks subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                            sample output                               explanation test case  the only strings that can be obtained by performing the given operations are   of these the two strings  and  contain exactly one occurrence of   test case  the given string ss cannot be changed by performing the given operation and contains  occurrences of the string  i e    test case  the only strings that can be obtained by performing the given operations are   the string  contains two occurrences of    author srikkanthadm editorial  codechef comproblemsmaxevswp tags                                   easy greedy march srikkanthadm                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
