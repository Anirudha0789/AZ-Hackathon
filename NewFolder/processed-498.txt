 read problem statements in mandarin bengali russian and vietnamese as well  two drunken players alice and bob are playing a modified version of tictactoe  initially there is a n×mn×m empty grid  alice and bob take alternate turns starting with alice  in her turn alice chooses an empty cell on the board and puts a a on the chosen cell  in bobs turn he chooses an empty cell and puts a b on the chosen cell  the player who first gets any k×kk×k subgrid completely filled with hisher initial wins the game  by a k×kk×k subgrid we mean the intersection of kk consecutive rows and kk consecutive columns  the players do not stop making turns after one of them wins and they play all n⋅mn⋅m turns until the grid is filled  you are given the sequence of moves played by each player the cell selected by the player in hisher turn  you have to output the winner of the game or report that there is no winner  input  the first line contains an integer tt the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains three integers nn mm kk  each of the next n⋅mn⋅m lines contains two integers xx yy the row and column of the cell chosen by the player with the current turn  output for each test case output alice if alice wins the game or bob if bob wins the game or draw if no one wins  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nm≤≤nm≤ ≤k≤minnm≤k≤minnm ≤x≤n≤x≤n ≤y≤m≤y≤m the sum of n⋅mn⋅m over all test cases does not exceed    subtasks subtask   points ≤n≤xa≤m≤≤n≤xa≤m≤ subtask   points ≤n≤xa≤m≤≤n≤xa≤m≤ subtask   points original constraints sample input                              sample output bob  explanation after  turns of the game the state of the grid is aaa  a bb babb  at this moment bob has achieved a subgrid of ×× with his initials while alice has not achieved it yet so bob is the winner   author ★kairakal editorial  codechef comproblemstictacto tags                                   binary search prefix sum                                                              algorithms searching simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
