  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  lets call arrays of the form x x     xk nice  in other words nice arrays are arrays that form increasing arithmetic progression with the difference of one  you are given an array of n integers  lets denote its numbers by a a     an  you are also given m change queries  every change query is a query of the form x y with the meaning that the xth number in it becomes equal to y  we perform these queries one after another strictly in this order  please calculate the length of the longest nice subarray of this array i e  the length of the longest segment l r that al al     ar is a nice array before all the queries and after every query  input the first line of input consists of two integers n and m separated by a single space  the length of the array and the number of queries  the second line of input consists of n integers the ith equals to ai  namely the ith number in the array  the following m lines contains the queries in the form x y where x and y are natural numbers with the meaning that the xth number becomes equal to y   output output the length of the longest nice subarray of the initial array at the first line of output  then output m integers at separate lines  the ith such line should contain the length of the longest nice subarray after the ith changing query  anytime ai    n holds   example input                   output        scoring    n     m     points     n m     points     n m      points    author sergeyadm tester  editorial  codechef comproblemssubsgm tags                                   segment trees advanced greedy                                                              advanced data structures advanced tree structures advanced algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
