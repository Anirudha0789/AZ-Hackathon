 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  abdullah has recently moved to tolland  in tolland there are nn cities numbered  through nn connected by n−n− bidirectional roads such that it is possible to visit any city from any other city  for each city ii there is a toll value tlitli  abdullah lives in city xx  he has planned a tour of tolland lasting for nn days  for each ii ≤i≤n≤i≤n on the i−i−th day he travels from city xx to city ii and on the iith day he travels from city ii back to city xx  in tolland there are also special discount coupons  for each city cc and positive integer vv there is a discount coupon for city cc with value vv  all discount coupons may be bought anywhere in tolland the cost of each discount coupon is twice its value  when travelling from any city ii to any not necessarily different city jj abdullah must pay a toll exactly once in each city on the path between them including ii and jj even if he passed through some cities before he must pay the toll in these cities as well  for any city ii the toll is tlitli when not using any discount coupons however if abdullah bought some discount coupons for city ii he may use some or all of them to decrease this toll to maxtli−vmaxtli−v where vv is the sum of values of coupons for city ii used by abdullah  each coupon may be used at most once per day but they do not expire when used and the same coupon may be used on multiple days  on each day abdullah may use any coupons he wants but a coupon for city ii may only be used to decrease the toll in city ii  abdullah has a travel budget on each day he must not spend more than kk units of money on paying tolls  before the start of the tour he may choose to buy any number of discount coupons for any cities and with any values possibly different ones for different cities the cost of coupons is not included in the budget for any day of the tour  help abdullah find the minimum total amount of money he must spend on discount coupons so that on each day during the tour he will be able to stay within his budget by using the coupons he bought  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains three spaceseparated integers nn xx and kk  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers tltl…tlntltl…tln  each of the next n−n− lines contains two spaceseparated integers uu and vv denoting that cities uu and vv are connected by a bidirectional road   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum amount of money abdullah should spend on coupons  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ≤xuv≤n≤xuv≤n ≤tli≤≤tli≤ for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points  each city is directly connected to at most two other cities city xx is directly connected to at most one city  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                             sample output                              explanation example case  the total costs of tolls on each day without purchasing any discount coupons would be   the budget  is exceeded on each day of the tour  however abdullah can buy a discount coupon with value  for city  and a discount coupon with value  for city   the total cost of these coupons is ⋅⋅⋅⋅  now the costs of tolls on each day are  and the budget is never exceeded  example case  the costs of tolls on each day without purchasing any discount coupons would be   since the budget is already never exceeded there is no need to buy any discount coupons   author ★abdullah tags                                   trees bottomup greedy dfs                                                              data structures graphs algorithms dynamic programming dp approach graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
