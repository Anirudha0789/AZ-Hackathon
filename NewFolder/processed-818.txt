  codechef has received an order from the president of mithai country for his sons birthday cake  the president is a person of very high temper and codechef doesnt want to tick him him so he had to prepare a cake exactly as described by the presidents son  he asked for a cake with n layers and each layer has to be of a type specified by him  the type of layer is represented by a lowercase letter from the english alphabet  codechef asked his sous chef jalebi bai to make this cake who was very sleepy due to a very long and tiring journey to a planet far far away earlier  due to tiredness jalebi bai screwed up the the layers while baking the cake  thankfully it has the same number of layers as required but any of the layers may or may not be the same as described in the order  codechef is really worried because of this as making a new cake will cost him a huge amount of money   at this point of time samosa bhai comes to the rescue  he has a layer swapper patent pending which can swap the layers of a cake without ruining the cake  this swapper has a limitation that it can swap layers separated exactly by distance d only meaning there should be exactly d layers in between the two layers to be swapped  you have to tell if the cake made by jalebi bai can be changed into the cake described by the presidents son using samosa bhais swapper   input the first line contains t the number of test cases  the first line of each test case contains n and d  the next line contains a lowercase string a representing the cake described by the presidents son  the next line contains a lowercase string b representing the cake made by jalebi bai  output for each test case output yes without quotes if it is possible to transform the cake b into cake a using the layer swapper  otherwise output no without quotes  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ d ≤  size of string a  size of string b  n  ≤ sum of n ≤  all characters are from a to z in string a and b   example input    qnyu ynqu   fbnc nbcf   abcde edacb   abcde edabc   eff bae  output yes yes no yes no explanation example case   swap layer y with q  example case   follow the following swap order  swap layer f with c the cake will now be nbfc swap layer n with b the cake will now be bnfc swap layer n with f the cake will now be bfnc swap layer f with b the cake will now be fbnc  example case   follow the following swap order  swap layer b with d the cake will now be ebadc swap layer a with e the cake will now be abedc swap layer e with c the cake will now be abcde   author ★devuy editorial  codechef comproblemskol tags                                   basic maths adhoc                                                              mathematics algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages java c cpp pyp  submit
