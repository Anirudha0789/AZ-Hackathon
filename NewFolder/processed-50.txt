  one day chef and his friend alice decide to build a device which will transfer the data between them  the data is transferred in binary form i e       when the device was built they tried to test it  while testing the device they found out that due to noise in the data transferring channel they didn’t receive the  data in exactly the same form some of the digits of the data were misplaced or missing  so chef and alice decided that chef will fine tune the device and send the  same data to alice for n number of times and the data with lowest error will be accepted   your task is to help alice find the ith sent data for which the minimum error is received   given that error  total no of wrong digits  total number of digits ×   input  the first line of input contains two integer n denoting the numbers of times the data was sent and l denoting the length of the data sent   the second line contains the correct data which is to be transferred  each of the following  n  lines contain the data sent by the device in the ith attempt  output output a single line containing the string which has the lowest error  noteif there are more than one possible output with the same minimum error then output the first string which has the minimum error  constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ l ≤  example input      example output    author ★rahulojha editorial  codechef comproblemschfdt tags                                   array ense rahulojha                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
