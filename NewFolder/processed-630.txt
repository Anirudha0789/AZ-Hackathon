 this is an interactive problem  note dont forget to flush your output after each print statement in c   fflushstdout in python   printyour output flushtrue in java  system out flush a pixel is usually represented in the rgb form representing the hexadecimal values of the amount of the color red green and blue respectively  you have been placed in a multinational company and are working on an image processing project  your boss has assigned you a task to determine the area of a black shape inside a rectangular image of dimensions n x m  the black shape may be either square or a rectangle and of any valid dimension aligned along the axes  it is guaranteed that there is only one such shape present inside the image  the image is a vivid colorful scenery with the black shape pasted on it  you are given the coordinates of the center point of the black shape inside the image  asking many doubts may get you fired from the job so to be on the safeside you may ask your boss at most q queries  in each query you provide your boss with i and j  the coordinates of the pixel present at ith column and jth row  the boss responds with the rgb values of the queried pixel  here they follow a different system of inverted blackwhite schema where the rgb value of black is assumed to be     we are following the cartesian coordinate system here where our coordinates are in the form xy in the quadrant of cartesian plane i e  x  y  nonnegative integers   your job is to determine the coordinates of the topleft corner coordinates of bottomright corner and what kind of shape it is  note if the shape is a square you cant use the logic that every square is a rectangle and output rectangle for every case if the shape is a square   you must output the shape name as square only  interaction  first your program should read a line containing a single integer ― the number of test cases t  the description of interaction for t test cases follows  read the first line of each test case that contains two spaceseparated integers n and m denoting number of rows and columns respectively read the second line containing two spaceseparated integers x and y denoting the coordinates of the center of the black shape inside the image for each test case you may ask at most q queries   to ask a query print a line containing the character q and two spaceseparated integers  i and j denoting the coordinates of the pixel you want rbg values for  you would get three space separated values represent red green and blue rbg value of the color or a negative integer if you have exceeded the limit on the number of queries the coordinates you printed are invalid or some other error occurred  when you determine the area and the type of shape you should print a line containing the character a followed by the xtopleft ytopleft xbottomright ybottomright  the coordinates of the topleft corner and bottomright corner of the black shape respectively and the type of shape output rectangle if the shape found is rectangle or square if it is a square note that when you read a negative integer you should immediately terminate your program to receive a wrong answer verdict otherwise you may receive any verdict  dont forget to flush the output after printing each line  constraints  the dimensions of the black shape are odd integers only  subtasks subtask   points   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n m ≤  q    subtask   points   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n m ≤  q    example you             grader                                                                      q                                          q                          q                          q                          q                          q                          q                          q                          q                          q                          q                          q                          q                          q                          q                          q                           a     square  author ★kushan editorial  codechef comproblemsvdpt tags                                   binarysearch easy imti kushan                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
