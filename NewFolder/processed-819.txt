 rohit has n empty boxes lying on the ground in a line  the size of the boxes is given in the form of an array aa  the size of the ith box is denoted by aiai  since rohit has a tiny room there is a shortage of space  therefore he has to reduce the number of boxes on the ground by putting a box into another box that is at least twice the size of the current box i e if we have to put the ith box into the jth box then ∗aiaj∗aiaj  each box can contain a maximum of one box and the box which is kept in another box cannot hold any box itself  find the minimum number of boxes that will remain on the ground after putting boxes into each other  input  the first line contains a single integer n  the next n lines contain the integer ai  the size of the ith box   output output a single integer denoting the minimum number of boxes remaining on the ground  constraints  ≤n≤∗≤n≤∗ ≤ai≤≤ai≤  subtasks   points  ≤n≤≤n≤  points  ≤n≤∗≤n≤∗  sample input       sample output    author ★decipher editorial  codechef comproblemsbxred tags                                   decipher medium popu sorting twopointers                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
