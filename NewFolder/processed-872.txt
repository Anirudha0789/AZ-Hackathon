 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  the droid rd is travelling in space with a special mission  in space there are nn planets numbered  through nn and mm bidirectional space highways  each space highway connects two planets and in order to use it rd needs to have a sufficiently high status level  the droid’s mission consists of qq stages  in each stage there are two planets xx and yy such that the droid should start the stage at planet xx with some initial status level ll l≥l≥ and travel to planet yy  for each valid ii when rd is at planet ii including the initial planet xx he may increase his status level by aiai it is not allowed to increase the status level multiple times on the same planet in the same stage  find the minimum value of ll such that it is possible for rd to reach planet yy or determine that it is impossible to reach planet yy for any ll  note that the level rd has at the end of each stage is not carried over to the next stages he may start the next stage with a lower initial status level  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an  each of the following mm lines contains three space separated integers uu vv and ww denoting that there is a space highway between planets uu and vv and rd may use this highway only if his status level is at least ww  the next line contains a single integer qq  the following qq lines describe stages  each of these lines contains two spaceseparated integers xx and yy   output for each stage print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum status level required to complete the stage or −− if it is impossible to complete this stage  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nmq≤≤nmq≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for each valid ii ≤w≤≤w≤ ≤uvxy≤n≤uvxy≤n the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed  the sum of mm over all test cases does not exceed  the sum of qq over all test cases does not exceed   subtasks subtask   points  nq≤nq≤ m≤m≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed  the sum of mm over all test cases does not exceed  the sum of qq over all test cases does not exceed   subtask   points aiai for each valid ii subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                                      sample output                                explanation in the second stage rd can travel through planets →→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→   author ★farhodfarmon editorial  codechef comproblemsrd tags                                   trees disjoint set union dfs order prims algorithm binary lifting sorting                                                              data structures graphs advanced data structures algorithms graph algos traversals tree algos lowest common ancestor dfs minimum spanning trees                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
