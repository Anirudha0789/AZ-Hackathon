 abhishek is very good in mathematics  now he came to know about dot product of vectors  so he asked his friend suyash a problem  he gave him two vectors a and b of length n   he asked him to minimize the dot product of these two vectors  suyash has a choice to change the order of the elements of these two vectors i e  for any two elements i  and j in any vector he can interchange the position of these elements  since suyash is new to programming he asked you to solve this problem for him xa input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the length of the vectors   the second  and third lines contain n spaceseparated integers a a     an and b b     bn denoting the elements of the vectors respectively  xa output for each test case output a single line containing the minimum dot product   constraints should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have  format it like   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ aibi ≤   xa example input                     output     author ★hsagarthegr editorial  codechef comproblemsbitmask tags                                   bitm easy hsagarthegr sorting vector                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
