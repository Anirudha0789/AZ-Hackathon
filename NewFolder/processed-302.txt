 read problem statements in russian and mandarin chinese  chef goes to a candy store that sells nn different candies  for each candy we know its price and sweetness  chef has dd dollars and can take a maximum of  candies one in each hand  find the maximum total sweetness he can buy under the given constraints  note since the inputoutput is large prefer using fast inputoutput methods   input format  the first line contains an integer tt the number of test cases  then the test cases follow   each test case contains three lines of input  first line will contain  space separated integers nn and dd the number of different candies and the amount of money chef has   second line contains nn space separated integers pp…pnpp…pn where pipi is the price of the ithith candy  third line contains nn space separated integers ss…snss…sn where sisi is the sweetness of the ithith candy    output format for each testcase output in a single line the maximum total sweetness chef can buy with the money he has and with at most two candies  constraints  ≤t≤ ∗≤t≤ ∗ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤d≤≤d≤ ≤pisi≤≤pisi≤ sum nn over all testcases is atmost                           sample input                                                                                      sample output                               explanation testcase  chef can collect both the candies available with the money he has  testcase  chef can collect candies at index  or   in both cases he will get the total sweetness of   testcase  since the price of all candies is the same its always optimal to choose the candies with maximum sweetness  also in this case no more than one candy can be chosen    author daanishadm editorial  codechef comproblemsmaxswt tags                                   priority queue sets multiset maps hashmaps greedy                                                              data structures queues algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
