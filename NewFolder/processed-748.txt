  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  a sequence is called nice if its elements are distinct consecutive numbers possibly in changed order  for example both    and     are nice while       and    are not   limak has a nice sequence  while he was in school today someone inserted one extra number in the sequence  limak has just returned and realized that the sequence isnt nice anymore he wants to remove the inserted number and make his sequence nice again  can you help him to find the number that he should remove  formally in each test case you are given a sequence of n numbers a a     an  your task is to find the value x such that removing one occurrence of x would make the sequence nice  its guaranteed that exactly one solution exists  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains an integer n denoting the size of the new sequence  the second line of a test case contains n integers a a     an denoting the new sequence  output for each test case output a single line containing one integer — a number that should be removed from the given sequence  constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ ai ≤  the given sequence isnt nice  there is exactly one solution  subtasks subtask   points  ≤ n ≤  subtask   points original constraints                         sample input                                                                              sample output                                explanation test case   the sequence a is       we should remove the number  and the remaining numbers will form a nice sequence      test case   we should remove one of two s to get the sequence   which is nice   author ★errichto tester ★xcwgf editorial  codechef comproblemsextran tags                                   case work adhoc observation                                                              special algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
