 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese russian vietnamese and bengali as well  this is an interactive problem  sushi has a sequence of integers aa…anaa…an each of them is between  and  inclusive  you do not know this sequence but for a strange reason maybe because you love her you have to find it  you may ask up to  queries  in each query  you should choose two integers kk and xx ≤k≤n≤k≤n ≤x≤≤x≤  sushi creates a new sequence bb…bnbb…bn where bkxbkx and if we deleted the element bkbk from this sequence we would obtain the sequence aa  then sushi tells you the number of inversions in the sequence bb i e  the number of pairs ijij such that ≤ij≤n≤ij≤n and bibjbibj   interaction  first you should read a line containing a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of interaction for tt test cases follows  for each test case you should start by reading a line containing a single integer nn  to ask a query you should print a line containing the character  followed by a space and two spaceseparated integers kk and xx describing your query  then you must read a line containing a single integer ― the answer to the query  when you have guessed the sequence print a single line containing the character  followed by a space and nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for each valid ii  this does not count as a query   if you ask more than  queries or do not follow the interaction format you may receive any verdict  do not forget to flush the output after printing each line constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  example input you             sushi                                                                                                                                                                                  explanation example case  the sequence sushi has is aa  your interaction with sushi is as follows     sushi creates the sequence bb and returns the number of inversions in it which is      sushi creates the sequence bb and returns the number of inversions in it which is      sushi creates the sequence bb and returns the number of inversions in it which is      sushi creates the sequence bb and returns the number of inversions in it which is      you have guessed the sequence to be  which is correct    author ★sjshohag editorial  codechef comproblemsinveract tags                                   interactive problems binary search                                                              special algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
