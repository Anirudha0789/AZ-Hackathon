 the crofts game lara and jonah were onto siberia for the expedition of the divine source  the flight was of  hours  to kill the time they both decided to play a game  the rules of the game are simple  the game starts with two ninteger arrays a and b and is played by two players  here lara and jonah both lara and jonah play in alternating turns with lara always playing first  during each turn the current player must choose an integer i such that   i  n –   if the current player is lara then she receives ai points if the current player is jonah then he receives bi points  each value of ‘i’ can be chosen only once either by lara or jonah not both  the game always ends after n moves  the player with the maximum number of points wins  task given the values of n a and b can you determine the outcome of the game  print ‘first’ if lara will win  print ‘second’ if jonah will win  print tie’ if they will tie   assume both players always play optimally  input format the first line of input contains a single integer testcases denoting the number of test cases  each of the  subsequent lines describes a test case  a single test case is defined over the following three lines   an integer n denoting the number of elements in arrays a and b    n spaceseparated integers a a a ……an where each ai describes the element at index i of array a    n spaceseparated integers b b b ……bn where each bi describes the element at index i of array b   constraints   testcases      n      ai bi     output format for each test case print one of the following predicted outcomes of the game on a new line print ‘first’ if lara will win  print ‘second’ if jonah will win  print ‘tie’ if they will tie    input                    output first tie second explanation testcase   a   b    lara and jonah make the following n moves          lara chooses i   and receives  points           jonah chooses i   and receives  points  note that jonah will not choose i   because this would            cause lara to win            lara chooses i   which is the only remaining move and receives  points   as all n   moves have been made the game ends  laras score is  points and jonahs score is  points so lara is the winner and we print ‘first’ on a new line   testcase   a   b    because both players will only make  move and all possible point values are  the players will end the game with equal scores  thus we print ‘tie’ on a new line   testcase   a   b    because both players will only make  move and all the possible point values for jonah are greater than all the possible point values for lara jonah will win the game  thus we print ‘second’ on a new line    author prescient editorial  codechef comproblemscroft tags                                   adhoc greedy medium prescient sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs nodejs bash js  submit
