 you may have helped chef and prevented doof from destroying the even numbers  but it has only angered dr doof even further  however for his next plan he needs some time  therefore doof has built nn walls to prevent chef from interrupting him  you have to help chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach dr doof  formally the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottomleft corner  dr  doof is located at the origin   there are nn walls the ith wall is a straight line segment joining the points aiai and aiai  for every initial position of chef xjyjxjyj find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching doof  obviously chef cant start from a point on the wall  therefore if xjyjxjyj lies on any of the given walls print −− in a new line  input  first line contains tt denoting the number of testcases  the first line of every test case contains a single integer nn denoting the number of walls dr doof has built  the next line contains nn space separated distinct integers each denoting aiai  the next line contains a single integer qq denoting the number of times chef asks for your help  the next qq lines contains two space separated integers xjxj and yjyj each denoting the coordinates of the starting point of chef   output for each query print the number of walls chef needs to break in order to reach dr doof in a separate line  if chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls print −−  constraints  ≤t≤∗≤t≤∗ ≤nq≤∗≤nq≤∗ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ ≤xjyj≤≤xjyj≤ aaa    anaaa    an sum of nn and qq over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed ∗∗                         sample input                                                                    sample output                                 explanation the sample input can be represented by the graph given below  if chef starts from  he can reach dr doof without destroying any wall  if chef starts from  he has to destroy the stst wall  if chef starts from  he has to destroy both the walls  if chef starts from  he has to destroy the stst wall  as  lies on the second wall the answer is −− for the last query   author ★sarthakmanna editorial  codechef comproblemsclpnt tags                                   cartesian coordinate system                                                              mathematics                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
