 egor came to the olympiad in informatics  but the tasks turned out to be too difficult so egor chose to sleep instead of solving problems  but as we all know everyone is very happy when someone is the first who solved the problem   there are nn problems in the contest  the iith of them was solved at minute lili for the first time  this task will stop increasing the joy of everyone around at the minute riri that is riri is the last minute when the task increases the joy  in other words the iith task increases the joyfulness for everyone by  unit from the minute lili to the minute riri  in the anime that egor watched recently there are various techniques that can make a person fall asleep  egor knows techniques that will allow him to sleep for any minutes between aa and bb minutes i e  egor can sleep for aa minutes aa minutes … bb minutes  egor can also combine techniques i e  he can choose techniques with different duration and then sleep the total time of all techniques  egor wants to combine techniques to wake up in the most joyful moment possible  your task is to find the maximum joy in which egor can wake up  input format  the first line of the input contains the number tt  the number of test cases  the test cases then follow  the first line of each test case contains integers nn aa and bb  the number of tasks and abab values described in the statement  the next nn lines give you a description of the problems  each line contains two numbers liriliri  a segment of joy for every task   output format for each test case print the maximum level of joy at which egor can wake up  constraints  ≤t≤⋅≤t≤⋅ ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ ≤a≤b≤≤a≤b≤ ≤li≤ri≤≤li≤ri≤ sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅  subtasks  subtask   points ≤li≤ri≤≤li≤ri≤ subtask   points aa subtask   points original constraints                         sample input                                                                                 sample output                               explanation  test case  we can use techniques  and  to wake up at minute   at that time there are  tasks that give egor joy task  which gives joy during the range  and task  which gives joy during the range   it can be proven that egor cannot acquire joy from all  tasks at the same time so  is the maximum joyfulness egor can wake up to  test case  we can use techniques   and  to wake up at minute   at that time  there are  tasks that give egor joy task  and task   test case  the maximum minute we can wake up to is ⋯⋯ which means we cannot acquire joy from any task    author ★vaaven editorial  codechef comproblemssleeptech tags                                   difference arrays maps sorting binary search prefix sum                                                              data structures arrays algorithms searching simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
