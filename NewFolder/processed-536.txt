 read problem statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef is playing a noob version of the game flappy bird with the following rules  the bird starts at a height hh at xx  there are nn obstacles numbered  through nn  for each valid ii the iith obstacle is at a position xixi and it has a height hihi  for each integer ii ≤ixn≤ixn chef has the option to click once when the bird is at xixi  lets denote the birds height yycoordinate at that point by jj  if he clicks the bird moves to xixi and yjyj  otherwise the bird moves to xixi and yj−yj−  there is no ceiling and all the obstacles extend upwards from the bottom and not the other way around  for each valid ii the bird crosses the iith obstacle successfully if the birds height at xxixxi is strictly greater than hihi  at any point before xxnxxn the birds height should remain nonnegative otherwise it will drown  if the bird crosses the nnth obstacle successfully chef wins the game   can you tell chef if he can win the game get the bird to cross all the obstacles and the minimum number of clicks required to win in such a case input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and hh  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers xx…xnxx…xn  the third line contains nn spaceseparated integers hh…hnhh…hn   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of clicks required to cross all the obstacles successfully or −− if it is impossible to cross all the obstacles  constraints  ≤t≤⋅≤t≤⋅ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤h≤≤h≤ ≤xx…xn≤≤xx…xn≤ ≤hi≤≤hi≤ for each valid ii the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅  example input                         example output     explanation example case  the figure below shows one possible way to successfully cross all the obstacles using the minimum number of clicks   example case  it is clear that even by clicking all the time it is impossible to cross the last obstacle    author daanishadm tester ★iscsi editorial  codechef comproblemsflappybd tags                                   greedy observation binary search                                                              algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
