 problem statement it is  and we are surrounded by cyborgs everywhere  geneo is one such cyborg with a human body and an electronic brain  to monitor skills and health of geneo he is posed with questions everyday  on one fine day geneo was asked the following question  you are given a string s of size n containing letters a to z  you are allowed to remove a character from the string and exchange it for a number signifying its position  i e a   b   c       z    after some number of these operations you arrive at a final array a  power p of any such array is defined as count of letters  count of numbers  sum of numbersk where k is a given integer and  denotes float division  geneo has to find maximum possible power pmax of such an array you want to test if geneo is right  for this you have to generate correct answers for the question  input section the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a two space separated integers n and k  the second line of each test case contains the string s of size n  output section for each test case output a single line containing two space seperated integers a and b such that a  b  pmax  the maximum possible power achievable after transformation and gcdab    input constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ k ≤                          sample input                               abcdefghij   qwertyuiop                          sample output                                explanation for the first test case if we replace no character we get an array comprising of letters only  this gives us the maximum power   for the second test case we get maximum power when we replace all the characters by respective numbers   author ★likecs editorial  codechef comproblemsicl tags                                   easy greedy icl likecs likecs                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
