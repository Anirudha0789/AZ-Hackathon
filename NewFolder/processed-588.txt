 important humans are in danger    it may be the end of the universe again    aliens again had stolen the important data about the birth of the human beings and as before they keep this data in their secured data center  with the help of these data along with the advanced technologies aliens had initiated a project called its the end to get rid of the human beings and occupy the earth  stupid humans how could they allow this again chef po has thought and started connecting to the aliens data center to save the earth again  the first thing he noticed is that there are n servers in the aliens data center and they are arranged in a line  aliens have rearranged the data center to avoid grid hacking mechanism refer to this but this is not needed to understand this problem  denote the ith server as serveri  ≤ i ≤ n   aliens had divided the data file with the data about the birth of the human beings into n parts denoted as fi  ≤ i ≤ n and placed the part fi at the serveri  each server has a password  a nonnegative integer  chef po needs to crack all the servers in order to get all parts of the data file  the aliens are really strange beings so they single out two types of passwords power password  a number of the form ab a b ≥   the list of power passwords starts with                 nonpower password  any other number  this list starts with                   for simplicity we shall call server secured by a power password as power server and the server secured by a nonpower password as nonpower server  all nonpower servers have a friendly screen with the color indicator  suppose you enter a password trying to guess the actual password of such a server  the indicator will then become green if you enter a number which is smaller than the actual password it will become red if your number is greater than the actual password or you will get the access to the server and thus to the needed part of the data file if the password is correct  on the other hand each power server has no such screen and the only way to crack it is to try all power passwords until you find out the correct password  so our chef simply iterate over the list of power passwords in increasing order and try them until he finds the correct password  after the last adventure with aliens chef became smarter so he will use binary search to crack nonpower servers  namely let a a a a     be the sequence of all nonpower passwords  at first he will try passwords a a a a     until he either reaches the correct one or the indicator becomes red for the first time  if indicator becomes red at the password a   then he enters a   at the next step and cracks the server since  is the only nonpower password less than   let the indicator becomes red at the password ak where k ≥  while for the password ak− indicator was green  then chef sets l  k− r  k and uses usual binary search to crack the server after that  namely at each step he sets m  l  r div  and checks the password am  if it is correct he finishes the process if indicator becomes green he sets l  m and continue the process finally if indicator becomes red he sets r  m and continue the process  lets consider some examples suppose the password is   its a power password so chef will not see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is a power server  hence he will try the password  then  and then  making  tries in all  suppose the password is   its a nonpower password so chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is a nonpower server  hence he will try the passwords a   a   in order making  tries in all  suppose the password is   its a nonpower password  hence he will try the passwords a   a   a   a   a   in order making  tries in all  suppose the password is   its a nonpower password  he will crack this server from the first try since a    you are the secret aliens agent that got to know about chefs plan  your first goal is to estimate the time chef will spend on cracking each server so that aliens headquarters would know how much time they have to stop the chef  chef spent one second to enter each password  input the first line of the input contains an integer n denoting the number of servers in the aliens data center  the second line contains n space separated integers  the ith number among them denotes the password at the serveri  output output a single line containing n space separated integers  the ith number among them should equal to the number of tries chef will use to crack the serveri  constraints  ≤ n ≤   ≤ each password ≤  chef po does not know this bound on the password and assumes that password can be any nonnegative integer when he is cracking example input         output        explanation the cracking process of first
