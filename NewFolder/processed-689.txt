 read problem statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  youre given a simple undirected graph gg with nn vertices and mm edges  you have to assign to each vertex ii a number cici such that ≤ci≤n≤ci≤n and ∀i≠jci≠cj∀i≠jci≠cj  for any such assignment we define didi to be the number of neighbours jj of ii such that cjcicjci   you want to minimise maxi∈  ndi−mini∈  ndimaxi∈  ndi−mini∈  ndi  output the minimum possible value of this expression for a valid assignment as described above and also print the corresponding assignment  note   the given graph need not be connected  if there are multiple possible assignments output anyone   since the input is large prefer using fast inputoutput methods   input format  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow  the first line of each test case contains two integers nmnm  the number of vertices and edges in the graph respectively  the next mm lines each contain two integers  xyxy denoting that there exists an edge between vertex xx and vertex yy   output format the output of each test case consists of two lines  the first line contains the minimum possible value of the expression described above  the second line contains nn space separated integers  the ithith of which is cici in the corresponding assignment   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nm≤⋅≤nm≤⋅ ≤x≠y≤n≤x≠y≤n the sum of nn across test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅  the sum of mm across test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅                          sample input                                                                                        sample output                                             explanation test case  the following assignment is optimal  cc cc cc cc cc  we can see that  has two neighbours with smaller values   and   vertex  is also its neighbour but has a larger value  therefore dd   similarly we can calculate  dd dd dd dd dd  therefore maxi∈  ndi−mini∈  ndimaxi∈  ndi−mini∈  ndi  −−     test case  the following assignment is optimal  cc cc cc cc cc  the values of dd are  dd dd dd dd dd  therefore maxi∈  ndi−mini∈  ndimaxi∈  ndi−mini∈  ndi  −−      author ★aryanagadm editorial  codechef comproblemsmindiff tags                                   greedy graph algos constructive                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
