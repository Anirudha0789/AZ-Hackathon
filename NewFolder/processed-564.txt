 xa fluffy the squirrel has an m times n grid of lights where some of them are turned on  he thinks a subrectangle of the grid is called beautiful if the number of lights that are on in the subrectangle is between l and r inclusive  he wonders how many beautiful subrectangles of the grid exist  can you help him with this task xa input the first line of input contains two integers m and n denoting the number of rows and columns of the grid respectively  the next m rows contain n characters each where each character is either  denoting a light which is on or  denoting a light which is off  finally the last line contains two integers l and r which denotes the minimum and maximum number of on lights a beautiful subrectangle can have  output output a single integer the number of beautiful subrectangles of the grid  constraints   ≤ m ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ l ≤ r ≤ mn  subtasks  subtask   points   ≤ m n ≤  subtask   points   ≤ m ≤   ≤ n ≤  subtask   points  original constraints  example input        output   xa explanation example case   there are  subrectangles containing  on lights and  subrectangle that contains  on lights  the entire rectangle  author ★zscoder editorial  codechef comproblemsmco tags                                   binarysearch dynamicprogramming easy slidingwindow zscoder                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java cpp pyth pyp  submit
