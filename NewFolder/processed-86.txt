 xa shini has n toys on the shelf of her room  each of her toys have a name  when she tried to arrange them in  alphabetical order she realized that the names of all her toys start with either km or l  if shini arranges  all her toys in a random order not in the alphabetical order then find the least number of her toys that  can be taken off the shelf so that no two adjacent toys have names starting with the same letter   xa input the first lint contains tthe number of test cases  the first line of each test cases contains integer n — the number of toys on the shelf  the next line contains string s which represents the first letter of each toy in order  well consider  the toys in the row numbered from  to n from left to right  then the ith character s equals k if th  e ith toys name starts with k l if it starts with l and m if it starts with m    xa output for each test cases print a single integer — the answer to the problem  constraints  ≤ t≤    ≤ n≤   xa example input    mllkl  output    xa explanation example case   in the given test case there are two adjacent toys whose names start with l  if any one of  those toys are removed then it is seen that the order of toys is mlkl and hence no two adjacent toys have the same name    author ★saquibhere editorial  codechef comproblemscoinys tags                                   array saquibhere                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
