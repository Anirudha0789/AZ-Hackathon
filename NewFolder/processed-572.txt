  in the magic land there is an annual parade hold on each spring  there are n cities in magic land and m directed roads between cities   on the parade there will be somemay be  heroes travel in this land for each hero he start at city begini traveling to some cities and finish at city endi  note that begini may be equals to endi but he must at least moved to another city during this travel  he can go on one road many times but it will have a cost for each time  the cost of this parade is the sum of these items    the sum of costs by traveling on roads  if a road is passed by k heroes then it must be count k times     if for a hero he ended at a city that not equals to his start city i e  begini  endi then it will cost c dollars to move him back to his home     if for a city there is no heroes visited then we must pay for the citizen c dollars as compensate  the value of c may change every year and we can predict this value in the following k years   your task is calculate the minimal cost of each year   input  in the first line there are  integers n m and k   in the following m lines  there will be  integers si ti and vi describing a directed road from si to ti cost vi dollars   in the next k lines there will be an integer ci describing the value of c in that year   output  output k lines each line contain an integer corresponding to the minimal cost of each year  constraints   n      m      k    si  ti   si ti  n    vi      c    note that there may be more than  road between a certain pair of cities   example input                       output    explanation  in the first year since c is very small an optimal solution is no hero travel we pay  dollar for each city as compensate   in the second year an optimal solution is one hero traveling in the path   we pay  dollars for the roads  dollars for taking him back to city  and pay  dollars for city  and  as compensate   in the third year one optimal solution is one hero traveling in the path  and another hero traveling in the path                                                                                        author chenadm tester â˜…laycurse editorial  codechef comproblemsparade tags                                   min cost max flow floyd warshalls algorithm binary search                                                              advanced algorithms advanced graph algos flow networks maximum flow algorithms graph algos shortest paths searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
