 recently zennyzenny read about arrayarray and now she is cracking arrays questions  she told about this to his friend zenzen  zenzen wants to check how much zennyzenny know about array  so he  has given her  an array of integers  of size nn   zenny′szenny′s task is to find out the sum of all distinct positive integer and distinct negative integers in  the given array   as zennyzenny is beginner in problem solving so she is looking for your help   input  first line will contain tt the number of testcases   each testcase contains of two  lines  first line  contains    nn  size of array and  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers   output for each testcase output in a single line  containing  s  and s where s and s are sum of distinct positive integers and sum of distinct negative integers respectively  sum will not be greater than  and will not be less than   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ −≤ai≤−≤ai≤  sample input               sample output       explanation case  distinct positive integers are     and distinct negative integers are                  sum of positive integers s is  and sum of negative integers s is                  so output is      case  distinct positive integers are    and distinct negative integers are                  sum of positive integers s is   and sum of negative integers  s is                   so output is       author ★aliencoder editorial  codechef comproblemssipm tags                                   aliencoder array cplusplus czen easy implementation set                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
