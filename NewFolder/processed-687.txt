 tyler is back this time with a bang  he has started taking project mayhem very seriously  also he has now become a professional hacker but in his path of achieving technical excellence he has become selfish but that’s cool  his goals are pretty clear erase all of his credit history from all the banks in a particular state and live a lavish life with his girlfriend marla in that state  he is finding a suitable state to live in such that all the banks in that state don’t have any of his credit history  it is very easy for him to clear the bank records but very difficult to find a soft target  the country is in the form of an n×mn×m grid and each state contains a number of banks  also there is a concept of strength for each states banks lower is the strength of a bank easier it is to hack it  all banks in a state have the same strength  two banks with the same strength are said to be in the same state if and only if they are side adjacent to each other  now tyler wants to live in a state where he can get the maximum number of banks  also he would prefer to have low strength for each bank in that state  help him out with his problem and make project mayhem a success  input  the first line of the input contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm  each of the next nn lines contain mm spaceseparated integers denoting the strength for each bank in the country   output print two spaceseparated integers denoting the strength of each bank and the number of banks in the chosen state  constraints  ≤nm≤≤nm≤ ≤strength≤≤strength≤  subtasks   points ≤nm≤≤nm≤  points original constraints  sample input                             sample output     author ★ankushkhanna editorial  codechef comproblemsmarla tags                                   ankushkhanna ankushkhanna breadthfirstsearch cobe depthfirstsearch easy graphs greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
