 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese russian vietnamese and bengali as well  chef is recently learning magic tricks that use a deck of cards  each card in this deck has an integer written on it  currently he is learning how to make the deck sorted in nondecreasing order from top to bottom of the numbers on the cards using at most one shuffle move  a shuffle move means taking an arbitrary number of cards from the top of the deck and putting them at the bottom of the deck in the same relative order  for example if we have a deck of cards with numbers  it is allowed to take the top three cards  and put them at the bottom the result is   you are trying to convince chef that sometimes it is impossible to sort the deck in nondecreasing order using at most one shuffle move  that is why you need to write a program that determines if it is possible to sort a given deck or not  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn   the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an denoting the cards in the deck from top to bottom   output for each test case print a single line containing the string yes if it is possible to sort the deck or no if it is impossible  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed  ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points  ≤n≤≤n≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   subtask   points original constraints  example input               example output no yes   author ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemscardmgk tags                                   adhoc observation                                                              algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
