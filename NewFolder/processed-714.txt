 the king of neverland plans to host a christmas dinner for all the k landlords numbered from  to k in the kingdom  the landlords are feudal and the king feels it might be good to get them all together under one roof  however he knows many of them really hate each other and seating them in the same dinner table may cause immediate problems  luckily he has two dinner tables in his banquet hall and he sets out to see if he can sit all of them while making sure that two landlords who hate each other are not seated at the same table  he will hold the dinner only if this is possible  you need to help him decide whether he can invite the landlords or not given the above constraint  also if he can invite them you need to help him find the number of people to be seated at each table  note that the number of people to be seated at each table may not be unique in which case you need to find any one possible way  it is known that every landlord hates at least one other landlord and if landlord u hates landlord v then landlord v also hates landlord u  input the first line contains the number of test cases n   n ≤   for each test case the first line contains the number of landlords k   k ≤   this is followed by k lines where the jth line contains the information about all the landlords that landlord j hates in the following format the first integer p    in the line contains the number of landlords that landlord j hates followed by p integers in the same line giving the id of the landlords that landlord j hates  note that since landlord u hates landlord v implies that landlord v also hates landlord u therefore if landlord v appears in landlord u’s list in the input then landlord u appears in landlord v’s list in the input  output for each test case print the case number followed by a colon followed by a single space followed by  integers separated by single space  the first integer is  if the landlords cannot be invited and  if they can be invited  if the first integer is  the second and the third integers must both be   if the first integer is  then the second and the third integer show the number of landlords to be seated in the two tables with the smaller number as the second integer and the larger as the third integer  sample input                                                                                 sample output case      case      case       author admin editorial  codechef comproblemskgpc tags                                   admin breadthfirstsearch graphs kgpros medium                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
