  according to many researches people can stand on a bus for several hours but waiting for a bus for more than  minutes at a bus station can make us exhausted  the chef is a perfect example for this fact  he always tries to reduce the longest period of time of waiting for a bus  therefore optimizing the traveling plan for him is far from an easy task  lets consider the bus system with n bus stations numbered from  to n and m buses numbered from  to m  each bus is represented by  integer numbers u v s e which means it will start at the bus station u at the time s and arrive at the bus station v at the time e with no intermediate bus stations  if passenger arrives at the bus station u at the time x ≤ s he has to wait for s − x units of time to catch this bus  note that if he arrives at the bus station u exactly at time s he can catch this bus with no waiting time  the chef starts at the time  in the bus station  and he wants to arrive at the bus station n in a way that the longest period that he spends for waiting for a bus is as small as possible  besides he must be at the bus station n before or at the time t for a specially important meeting  note that he may wait for a meeting if he arrives at the bus station n early but that period is not our concern here since he doesnt wait for any bus at that time   input  the first line of the input contains three spaceseparated integers n t and m denoting the number of bus stations the deadline for coming to bus station n and the number of buses respectively  each of the following m lines contains four spaceseparated integers u v s e the parameters of the current bus as described in the problem statement   output  if chef cannot arrive at the bus station n before or at the time t output   otherwise output the maximum period of time he has to wait for a bus in the optimal traveling plan   constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ t ≤   ≤ m ≤    ≤ u ≤ n  ≤ v ≤ n u ≠ v  ≤ s  e ≤   example input                         output   explanation  there are three different traveling plans bus  → bus  → bus   his waiting time for each bus is    respectively  bus   his waiting time is   bus  → bus   his waiting time for each bus is   respectively   for each traveling plan chef arrives at the bus station n   before the time t    but only the first traveling plan is optimal since the longest period of time his has to wait is     author tuanadm tester ★antonlunyov editorial  codechef comproblemstabus tags                                   bfs sorting binary search                                                              algorithms graph algos traversals searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
