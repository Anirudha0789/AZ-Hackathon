  joey is given a problem by his friend chandler  since he is not good in maths he told you to help him solve the problem  can you help joey to solve the problem  the problem is that given an array a with n integers a a a      an you need to find an integer x such that the  expression a  x  a  x       an  x is minimum possible    input  the first line contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the first line of each test case contains an integer n denoting the number of integers in the array  the second line contains n spaceseparated intergers denoting the array elements  output for each test case output the number x in a new line  if there are multiple answers output the maximum one   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ ai ≤  example input        example output  explanation for every possible value of x x   gives the minimum value               author ★horsbug editorial  codechef comproblemsmnzeq tags                                   binarysearch encoding greedy horsbug horsbug math                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit    secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
