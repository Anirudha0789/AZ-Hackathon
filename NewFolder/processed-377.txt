  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian   you are given a array a of n positive integers and you can perform the following operation on the array  pick any two indices i and j in the array  divide ai and aj by some common factor of ai and aj  you can perform the above operation as many number of times as you want and the aim is to minimize the product of the resulting array  find this minimum product  since the answer can be a large number print the product modulo     input first line contains t number of testcases  each testcase contains  lines  first line of each testcase contains single integer n size of the array second line of each testcase contains n space separated integers the array a  output for each testcase output single line indicating the answer to that testcase  constraints t  points  n ai  points  n ai  sample input       sample output   explanation first divide first and third numbers by  then the second and third by   this makes all numbers equal to  hence the product is                                                                                       author ★piyushkumar tester ★balajiganapath editorial  codechef comproblemsmprod tags                                   frequency arrays prime divisors greedy                                                              data structures arrays mathematics number theory integer factorisation divisors algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
