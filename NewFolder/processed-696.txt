 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  there is a graph consisting of n nodes and m edges  there is a snake in each of its nodes  these snakes want to stage a coup against the mongoose who controls and puts restrictions on various aspects of their life  if there is an edge between some two nodes then it means that the snakes in those nodes can talk with each other  the mongoose wants to protect himself against the coup  first he calculates the degree of each node i e  the number of snakes a snake can talk to  he starts with an integer d   and goes till d  n    at each such d he will select the set of nodes that have their degree the originally computed degree because the mongoose doesnt like to compute the degree each time less than or equal to d  he will remove all the edges whose one or both the endpoints belong to this set  the snakes want to find for each d the minimum number of edges or communication channels that they should add so that each of the snakes is able to talk to every other snake either directly via an edge or via other snakes indirectly  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of the each test case contains two space separated integers n m  each of the next m lines contain two space separated integers ui vi denoting that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi  output for each test case output n space separated integers corresponding to answers for d   to n    constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ m ≤ minn  n         ≤ ui  vi≤ n ui ≠ vi the graph doesnt have self loops and multi edges   example input             output       explanation example   the degree of the nodes are        for d   all the vertices and edges are the present in the graph  the snakes can talk to each other already and there is no need to add more edges  so the answer is zero for d     for d   the chosen vertex set will be     the set of edges that will be removed will be     and    only the edge   is remaining  now in order to talk with each other at least  edges must be added  one way of doing this is to add the three edges removed  for d   the chosen vertex set will be      all the edges of the graph will be removed  now in order to talk with each other at least  edges must be added to the graph  for d   and d   also all the edges will be removed and at least  edges must be added to the graph in order for all the snakes to talk with each other   author admin tester ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemssngraph tags                                   graphs disjoint set union                                                              data structures advanced data structures                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
