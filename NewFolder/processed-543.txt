 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given n integers  in each step you can choose some k of the remaining numbers and delete them if the following condition holds let the k numbers youve chosen be a a a     ak in sorted order  then for each i ≤ k   ai must be greater than or equal to ai  c  you are asked to calculate the maximum number of steps you can possibly make  input  the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of each testcase follows  the first line of each testcase contains three integers n k and c the second line of each testcase contains the n initial numbers  output for each test case output the answer in a new line  subtasks subtask   points   ≤ n ≤    ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤     subtask   points  original constraints  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤     ≤ k ≤   ≤ c ≤   ≤ ai ≤   ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤                              sample input                                                                        sample output                              explanation testcase  you can make one step by choosing     testcase  you can make one step by choosing    and another by choosing      author ★arpa editorial  codechef comproblemsdivset tags                                   greedy sorting binary search                                                              algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
