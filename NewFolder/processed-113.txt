  read problems statements in mandarin chineserussian and vietnamese as well  the snakes want to build a temple for lord cobra  there are multiple strips of land that they are looking at but not all of them are suitable  they need the strip of land to resemble a coiled cobra  you need to find out which strips do so  formally every strip of land has a length  suppose the length of the ith strip is is ni then there will be ni integers hi hi    hini which represent the heights of the ground at various parts of the strip in sequential order  that is the strip has been divided into ni parts and the height of each part is given  this strip is valid if and only if all these conditions are satisfied  there should be an unique centre part  this is where the actual temple will be built  by centre we mean that there should be an equal number of parts to the left of this part and to the right of this part  hi   the heights keep increasing by exactly  as you move from the leftmost part to the centre part  the heights should keep decreasing by exactly  as you move from the centre part to the rightmost part  note that this means that hini should also be    your job is to look at every strip and find if its valid or not  input  the first line contains a single integer s which is the number of strips you need to look at  the description of each of the s strips follows the first line of the ith strips description will contain a single integer ni which is the length and number of parts into which it has been divided  the next line contains ni integers hi hi    hini  these represent the heights of the various parts in the ith strip   output  for each strip in a new line output yes if is a valid strip and no if it isnt   constraints   ≤ s ≤    ≤ ni ≤    ≤ hij ≤    example input                                               output yes no no no yes no no  explanation in the first strip all the conditions are satisfied hence it is valid  in the second strip it does not start with a  and hence is invalid  in the third strip it keeps increasing even past the centre instead of decreasing  hence invalid  the fourth strip does not increase and decrease by exactly   hence invalid  the fifth satisfies all conditions and hence is valid  the sixth and seventh strip do not have a centre part  because for every part there are either more parts to its right than its left or more parts on its left than its right  hence both the strips are invalid    author admin tester ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemstemplela tags                                   basic maths implementation                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
