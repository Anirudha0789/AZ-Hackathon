 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and bengali as well  a tree is defined as a connected undirected graph with nn vertices and n−n− edges  the distance between two vertices in a tree is equal to the number of edges on the unique simple path between them  you are given two integers xx and yy  construct a tree with the following properties  the number of pairs of vertices with an even distance between them equals xx  the number of pairs of vertices with an odd distance between them equals yy   by a pair of vertices we mean an ordered pair of two possibly the same or different vertices  input the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  each test case consists of one line containing two spaceseparated integers xx and yy  output for each test case if there is no tree satisfying the given properties print no without quotes  otherwise on the first line print yes without quotes  then print integer nn denoting the number of vertices in the tree followed by n−n− lines describing the edges of the tree in any order  vertices are numbered from  to nn  if there are multiple answers print any of them  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤xy≤≤xy≤ xy≤xy≤  example input           example output yes    yes              no no  explanation in the first test case  the pairs  and  have an even distance while the pairs  and  have an odd distance   author ★zoooma editorial  codechef comproblemstdists tags                                   trees greedy observation                                                              data structures graphs algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
