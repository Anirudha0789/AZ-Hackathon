 there are nn shops in a city each producing a particular number of vada pavs  you are also given an integer kk  find the difference between the sum of the vada pavs produced in the kk largest vada pavs producing shops and that of the kk least vada pavs producing shops  input format  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow  first line of each testcase contains two integers nknk  second line of each testcase contains nn spaced integers   output format for each testcase output in a single line the required answer  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤n≤k≤n ≤ai≤≤ai≤                         sample input                                                                  sample output                              explanation case   since k  largest vada pavs selling shops produces  and  vada pavs respectively similarly  smallest vada pavs selling shops produces  and  vada pavs respectively  hence the required answer will be                                                                            case   since k the largest vada pav shop sells  vada pavs whereas the smallest vada pav shop sells  vada pav therefore the required answer is    author ★dharsanr editorial  codechef comproblemschaat tags                                   dharsanr easy sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
