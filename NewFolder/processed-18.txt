 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you want to build a temple for snakes  the temple will be built on a mountain range which can be thought of as n blocks where height of ith block is given by hi  the temple will be made on a consecutive section of the blocks and its height should start from  and increase by exactly  each time till some height and then decrease by exactly  each time to height   i e  a consecutive section of       x x x x     can correspond to a temple  also heights of all the blocks other than of the temple should have zero height so that the temple is visible to people who view it from the left side or right side  you want to construct a temple  for that you can reduce the heights of some of the blocks  in a single operation you can reduce the height of a block by  unit  find out minimum number of operations required to build a temple  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains an integer n  the next line contains n integers where the ith integer denotes hi output for each test case output a new line with an integer corresponding to the answer of that testcase  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ hi ≤   example input                  output     explanation example   the entire mountain range is already a temple  so there is no need to make any operation  example   if you reduce the height of the first block to   you get      the blocks    form a temple  so the answer is   example   one possible temple can be       it requires  operations to build  this is the minimum amount you have to spend in order to build a temple   author admin tester ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemssntemple tags                                   d arrays arithmetic binary search                                                              data structures arrays mathematics basic maths algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
