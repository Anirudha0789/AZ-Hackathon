  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian the new king of byteland john has just ascended the throne  as every new king he wants to build a spectacular palace to showcase his wealth and power  we can consider byteland as an n x m rectangular matrix a  if aij is positive then it means that aij litres of oxygen are produced by trees in the cell with coordinates i j every day  on the other hand a negative value of aij indicates that a byteland resident lives in this cell who consumes aij litres of oxygen every day  the palace will occupy some rectangle submatrix of a  all the cells within the palace premises will not produce nor consume any oxygen  byteland scientists discovered the new important fact if byteland will be producing s less litres of oxygen every day than it produces now it will lead to a natural disaster  so now everyone is interested in the following question how many ways exist for choosing a rectangular region for the planned palace input the first line contains one integer t denoting the number of testcases  each testcase starts with a line containing three spaceseparated integers n m and s  the following n lines contain m integers each and describe the cells of the matrix a  output for each testcase output a single line containing one integer  the number of rectangles where the palace can be built without causing a disaster  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n m ≤   ≤ aij ≤   ≤ s ≤     subtasks  subtask   points  ≤ n m ≤  time limit   sec subtask   points  ≤ n m ≤  time limit   sec subtask   points  ≤ n m ≤  time limit   sec    example input                        output      explanation test case  we have the following matrix a        there are  rectangular submatrices with sum ≤ s   all the  cells themselves  columns the left and the middle  row the first and  segments in the first row of length  each   author ★pavel tester ★xcwgf editorial  codechef comproblemssvntr tags                                   fenwick trees merge sort                                                              advanced data structures advanced tree structures algorithms sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit    secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
