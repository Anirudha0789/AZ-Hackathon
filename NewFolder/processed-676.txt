  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  bearland consists of n cities numbered  through n  cities are connected with bidirectional roads  cities  through k were built a long time ago when citizens liked order and regularity  each pair of those old cities is connected with a road of length x  note that this description generates kk roads  there are m newer roads not necessarily of the same lengths  the ith of them connects cities ai and bi and has length ci  there is no road that connects a city to itself  all mkk roads are distinct ie  no two of them connects the same pair of cities  its guaranteed that its possible to get from every city to every other city using one or more roads  limak a bear lives in the city s  in order to plan a trip to some other city for every city he wants to know how quickly he can get there  can you help him and find the distance from s to every city the distance between two cities is the minimum total length of a path sequence of roads between the two cities  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows   the first line of each test case contains five integers n k x m and s denoting the number of cities the number of old cities the length of a road between every two old cities the number of newer roads and the city where limak lives respectively   each of the following m lines contains three integers ai bi and ci denoting a road of length ci between cities ai and bi  as guaranteed above no two cities are connected with more than one road no road connects a city to itself and its possible to get from every city to every other city  output for each test case output a single line containing n integers  the ith of them should denote the distance from the city s to the city i  the distance from s to s is simply   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ k ≤ n ≤   ≤ m ≤   ≤ s ai bi ≤ n  ≤ x ci ≤   subtasks  subtask   points  ≤ k ≤  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                                                      sample output                                                explanation test case   there are n   cities  the first k   of them are all connected with each other with roads of length x    there are m   extra roads  cities  and  are connected with a road of length   cities  and  are connected with a road of length    we are asked to compute distances to all cities from the city s    note that the distance from a city to itself is  and this is why the third number in the ouput is    author ★errichto editorial  codechef comproblemscliqued tags                                   dfs bfs                                                              algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
