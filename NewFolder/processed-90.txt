 there are nn hills each having the elevation associated with it  you need to find out the hill range of length kk having the maximum beauty  a range can be formed by deleting some of the hills from the array of elevations  a hill range xx is more beautiful than another hill range yy of the same length if in the first hill where xx and yy differ xx has a lower elevation than the yy  the length of a range is the number of hills present in it  input  firstline will contain tt the number of test cases  then the test cases follow   first line of each test case will have two integers nknk   secondline will have nn integers representing the elevation of hills   output  for each test case output kk integers representing the elevation of hills in the most beautiful range   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤n≤k≤n  subtasks   points  ≤n≤≤n≤  points  ≤n≤≤n≤  sample input                      sample output        explanation possible ranges are         among these   is the most beautiful and hence is the answer    author pecchapter editorial  codechef comproblemsranges tags                                   array easy pecchapter stack                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
