 youre given a sequence of nn distinct integers  you need to find a subsequence of length kk with the maximum possible median  the median of a sequence is the value of the element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in nondecreasing order  if the length of the sequence is even the left of two middle elements is selected  for example if the sequence is  then the median is  since after sorting it will look like  and  is the only middle element  the median of  is  since after sorting the value  is the left of the two middle elements  and   a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements  for example if the sequence is  then    are some valid subsequences but   are not  input format  the first line will contain tt the number of test cases  the description of test cases follow  the first line of each test case consists of two spaceseparated integers nn the length of the sequence and kk the length of the subsequence to be found  the second line of each test case consists of nn distinct spaceseparated integers aiai the elements of the sequence   output format  for each test case output two lines  the first line should consist of the median of the subsequence with the maximum median  the second line should consist of kk spaceseparated integers representing a subsequence with that median  if there are multiple such subsequences print any   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤k≤n≤×≤k≤n≤× ≤ai≤≤ai≤ sum of nn over all test cases wont exceed ××                         sample input                                                             sample output                                 author ★hitchhiker editorial  codechef comproblemssubmedia tags                                   sorting subsequence                                                              data structures arrays algorithms groupings                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
