  read problems statements in mandarin chinese and russian as well  recently max has visited the place where the wild things are again  he was very happy to know that the monsters are living in peace now  his friend carol was so excited about maxs coming back that he proposed everyone a brand new game  unfortunately all the wild things refused to play the game except max and k w  so there were only three players playing the game   the area where the game takes place is the cartesian planelink  there are n interesting points on the plane   each interesting point has integer coordinates  also all the interesting points form a strictly convex polygonlink   there is no need to explain the rules of the game but its quite important to mention the preparation process in order to play the game the playersmax k w  and carol must choose three different interesting points and plant  themselves there  also they must choose some positive integer s   lets assume that maxs interesting point is a k w s  b and carols  c  if the area of triangle abc is greater than or equal to s then the game will be awesome   otherwise it will be awful  now max is on his way home  his head is filled up with the memories about the wonderful game he used to play with his friends  but theres the thing that annoys him he remembers that he played the game q times but he cant recall any interesting point chosen by him max exactly remembers that in the beginning of ith game k w  chose point b  bi carol chose point c  ci and s was equal to si  also he remembers that all the games were awesome  so you are to calculate the number of different interesting points that could be chosen by max as a in the beginning of ith game  this number can be equal to zeroin that case we can conclude that ith game wasnt awesome  anyway just output zero   input the first line of a test case contains two integers n and q denoting the number of the interesting points and the number of times max played the game  the next n lines contain two integers xi and yi each denoting coordinates of ith interesting point  the points are indexed  the next q lines contain three integers bi ci and si each  in the beginning of ith game k w  chose point bith interesting point carol chose cith interesting point and s was equal to si  its guaranteed that the interesting points form a strictly convex polygon and are given in clockwise or counterclockwise order  its also guaranteed that there are no three vertices in the input that lie on one line and no point is given twice  output for each round of the game output a single line containing the number of different interesting points that could be chosen by max as a in the beginning of the corresponding game  constraints  ≤ n ≤   ≤ q ≤  x y ≤  for each interesting point  ≤ b   c ≤ n s ≤  for each game  example input                  output   explanations  for the first query a could be equal to both  and  for the second query there are no possible variants for a    author ★kostyaby tester ★rustinpiece editorial  codechef comproblemswthings tags                                   polygons binary search ternary search                                                              advanced algorithms computational geometry algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
