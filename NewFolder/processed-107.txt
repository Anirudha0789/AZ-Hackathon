 chef is currently working for a secret research group called nextgen  while the rest of the world is still in search of a way to utilize helium as a fuel nextgen scientists have been able to achieve  major milestones  finding a way to make a nuclear reactor that will be able to utilize helium as a fuel obtaining every bit of helium from the moons surface  moving forward the project requires some government funding for completion which comes under one condition to prove its worth the project should power chefland by generating at least aa units of power each year for the next bb years  help chef determine whether the group will get funded assuming that the moon has xx grams of helium and  gram of helium can provide yy units of power  input format  the first line of input contains an integer tt the number of testcases  the description of tt test cases follows  each test case consists of a single line of input containing four spaceseparated integers abxyabxy respectively   output format for each test case print on a single line the answer — yes if nextgen satisfies the governments minimum requirements for funding and no otherwise  you may print each character of the answer string in either uppercase or lowercase for example the strings yes yes yes and yes will all be treated as identical  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤abxy≤≤abxy≤  subtasks subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                      sample output                            yes no yes no explanation test case  chefland requires aa units of power for the next bb years  in total the moon must be capable of providing a⋅ba⋅b units of power  there are in total xx grams of helium on the moon which is capable of providing x⋅yx⋅y units of power   so the project satisfies the minimum requirements for funding  thus the answer is yes  test case  the total amount of power needed by chefland is a⋅ba⋅b whereas the total that can be provided by the helium present on the moon is x⋅yx⋅y which is insufficient to receive funding so the answer is no  test case  the total amount of power needed by chefland is a⋅b⋅a⋅b⋅ and the total that can be provided by the helium present on the moon is x⋅y⋅x⋅y⋅ which is sufficient to receive funding so the answer is yes  test case  the total amount of power needed by chefland is a⋅b⋅a⋅b⋅ and the total that can be provided by the helium present on the moon is x⋅y⋅x⋅y⋅ which is insufficient to receive funding so the answer is no   author srikkanthadm editorial  codechef comproblemshelium tags                                   cakewalk feb math srikkanthadm                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
