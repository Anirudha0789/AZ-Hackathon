  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  today puppy tuzik is going to a new dog cinema  he has already left his home and just realised that he forgot his dogcollar this is a real problem because the city is filled with catchers looking for stray dogs  a city where tuzik lives in can be considered as an infinite grid where each cell has exactly four neighbouring cells those sharing a common side with the cell  such a property of the city leads to the fact that the distance between cells xa ya and xb yb equals xa  xb  ya  yb  initially the puppy started at the cell with coordinates    there are n dogcatchers located at the cells with the coordinates xi yi where  ≤ i ≤ n  tuziks path can be described as a string s of m characters each of which belongs to the set d u l r corresponding to it moving down up left and right respectively  to estimate his level of safety tuzik wants to know the sum of the distances from each cell on his path to all the dogcatchers  you dont need to output this sum for the staring cell of the path i e  the cell with the coordinates    input the first line of the input contains two integers n and m  the following n lines contain two integers xi and yi each describing coordinates of the dogcatchers  the last line of the input contains string s of m characters on the set d u l r   d  decrease y by  u  increase y by  l  decrease x by  r  increase x by   output output m lines for each cell of the path except the starting cell output the required sum of the distances  constraints   ≤ n ≤  ✕   ≤ m ≤  ✕   ≤ xi yi ≤                          sample input                                  rdl                          sample output                               explanation  initially tuzik stays at cell    lets consider his path  move r to the cell    distance to the catcher   equals  distance to the catcher   equals  so the total distance equals  move d to the cell    distance to the catcher   equals  distance to the catcher   equals  so the total distance equals  move l to the cell    distance to the catcher   equals  distance to the catcher   equals  so the total distance equals   author ★pavel tester ★kostyaby editorial  codechef comproblemsppcts tags                                   d arrays geometry adhoc sorting observation binary search prefix sum                                                              data structures arrays mathematics algorithms constructive searching simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
