 read problems statements in russian vietnamese hindi mandarin chinese and bengali as well  chef has an inventory which can be represented as a row of nn cells numbered  through nn  each cell is either empty or contains a box  chef wants to rearrange the boxes in such a way that they are all on the left side of the inventory so if there are kk boxes they should occupy the leftmost kk cells  he may perform two types of moves  choose a cell ii ≤i≤n−≤i≤n− if cells ii and ii are empty and cell ii contains a box chef stands in cell ii and pushes the box from cell ii to cell ii choose a cell ii ≤i≤n−≤i≤n− if cells ii and ii are empty and cell ii contains a box chef stands in cell ii and pulls the box in cell ii to cell ii  the moves may be performed in any order any number of times possibly zero  find the minimum number of moves required to get all boxes to the left side of the inventory or determine that it is impossible  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the second line contains a string with length nn describing the inventory  for each ii ≤i≤n≤i≤n the iith character of this string is  if the iith cell contains a box or   if the iith cell is empty   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of moves required or −− if it is impossible to move all boxes to the left  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   example input                 example output      author ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemsinventry tags                                   greedy adhoc observation implementation                                                              algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
