 read problem statement in mandarin chinese and vietnamese  tweedledee and tweedledum are playing a fierce match of binary nim  this novel game is played with nn stacks each of them containing only s and s  just like in normal nim tweedledee and tweedledum alternate turns in their turn a player must choose one nonempty stack and remove a positive number of elements from the top of this stack  however tweedledee may only choose a stack with  at the top and remove elements from it afterwards and similarly tweedledum may only choose a stack with  at the top  the player that cannot make a move loses suzumo does not want to wait for the end of the game so given the starting player he asks you to determine the winner  remember that tweedledee and tweedledum are legendary grandmasters of combinatorial games so both always play optimally  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains an integer nn a string ss denoting the number of stacks the player that starts the game respectively  each of the following nn lines contains a single binary string bb representing a stack the first character of bb corresponds to the top element of the stack and the last character to the bottom element   output for each test case print a single line containing the string dee if tweedledee wins the match or dum if tweedledum wins  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤b≤≤b≤ each character in bb is either  or  ss is either dee or dum                         sample input                              dee    dum                            sample output                            dum dee  author ★alei editorial  codechef comproblemsbinim tags                                   game theory adhoc                                                              algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
