 read problem statements in bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given a tree with nn nodes numbered  through nn rooted at node   for each valid ii node ii has a value aiai written on it  an undirected simple path between any two nodes uu and vv is said to be vertical if uvuv or uu is an ancestor of vv or vv is an ancestor of uu  lets define a vertical partition of the tree as a set of vertical paths such that each node belongs to exactly one of these paths  you are also given a sequence of nn integers bb…bnbb…bn  a vertical partition is good if for each of its paths we can permute the values written on the nodes in this path and this can be done in such a way that we reach a state where for each valid ii the value written on node ii is bibi  the difficulty of your task is described by a parameter ss  if ss your task is only to determine whether at least one good vertical partition exists  if ss you are required to find the number of good vertical partitions modulo    input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and ss  each of the next n−n− lines contains two spaceseparated integers uu and vv denoting that nodes uu and vv are connected by an edge  the next line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an  the line after that contains nn spaceseparated integers bb…bnbb…bn   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer  if ss this integer should be  if a good vertical partition exists or  if it does not exist  if ss this integer should be the number of good vertical partitions modulo     constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ s∈s∈ ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n the graph described on the input is a tree ≤aibi≤≤aibi≤ for each valid ii the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   subtasks subtask   points time limit  seconds the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed  subtask   points time limit  seconds ss subtask   points time limit  seconds original constraints                          sample input                                                                                                                      sample output                                explanation example case  the good vertical partitions are  and   example case  the good vertical partitions are      example case  the same as example case  but with ss  example case  there is no good vertical partition   author amed editorial  codechef comproblemstreeperm tags                                   deque trees multiset dynamic programming greedy dfs bfs                                                              data structures queues graphs sets algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit    secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
