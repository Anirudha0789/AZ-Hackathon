 read problem statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef has been studying the human sleep cycle for years  he divides a day into ll units of time numbered  through ll  chefs research shows that his body requires spending only hh continuous units of time per day on sleep — then he can stay active during work  however in case of travel or any other responsibilities he might not be able to achieve this ideal state  next chef noticed that if he sleeps for xx xhxh continuous units of time and then performs some other activity he can still meet his daily sleep quota but the remaining time he needs to spend on continuously sleeping becomes ⋅h−x⋅h−x  he can further split this sleeping time in the same way i e  if he now sleeps for yy more y⋅h−xy⋅h−x continuous units of time his required sleeping time becomes ⋅⋅h−x−y⋅⋅h−x−y and so on  you are given a string ss with length ll for each valid ii the iith character of this string is  if the iith unit of time is free so chef can use it to sleep or  if it is occupied  can chef ever get enough sleep to feel fresh during his work given that he can choose when to sleep in his free time input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers ll and hh  the second line contains a single string ss with length ll   output print a single line containing the string yes if chef can have the required amount of sleep or no if he cannot without quotes  you may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase for example the strings yes yes yes and yes will all be treated as identical  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤h≤l≤≤h≤l≤ ss contains only characters  and                          sample input                                                                  sample output                            no yes yes no explanation example case  chef needs only  unit of sleep but since he is busy all the time he cannot sleep at all  example case  chef needs only  unit of sleep and he has exactly one unit of time when he is free so he can sleep during that unit of time  example case  chef needs  continuous units of sleep  first he spends the first  free units of time and then he needs ⋅−⋅− continuous units of sleep which he has available as the last  free units of time  example case  chef needs  units of sleep  if he spends the first  units of time he still needs ⋅−⋅− continuous units of sleep but only a single unit of time is left now so he is unable to get enough sleep   author daanishadm tester ★iscsi editorial  codechef comproblemsslpcycle tags                                   string                                                              data structures                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
