  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  sereja have an array a  a a     an where n is an even integer  let the function fa be defined by fa  a  a       an − an  an       an  sereja want to decrease the value fa by the unusual way  let al  r denote the subarray al al     ar of a  sereja can shift some subarray al  r where  ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n then the array a will become a a     al al al     ar al ar ar     an  for example we have the array a       and we choose  l   r   then after shifting we have the following array a        sereja can shift multiple times however its burdensome to shift many elements  thus the sum of r − l   should not exceed  × n  please help sereja to find the way for decreasing the value fa  a  a       an − an  an       an as much as possible  note that you dont have to minimize the value fa but the smaller value will give the higher score  input each test file contains only one test case  the first line of input contains an integer n denoting the length of the array  then the next line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an  output the first line should contain an integer q denoting the number of shifts  then the kth line of the next q lines should contain two spaceseparated integers l and r denoting the kth shift where  ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n  constraints   ≤ n ≤  that is  ≤ n ≤   ≤ ak ≤  that is  ≤ ak ≤  n is even  example input          output        input        output       scoring let init be the initial value of fa and s be the value of fa after shifting denoted by output  for each test file your score is calculated as init − s  init where you can assume init ≠  for all official test files  then the total your score is defined as the average of your score for the test files see the next paragraph for more details  the aim for this problem is to maximize the total your score  we have  official test files  you must correctly solve and decrease the value fa strictly for all test files to receive accepted  invalid outputs or s ≥ init for some test cases will lead wrong answer  you can assume that one can get accepted for the official test files  during the contest the scores of the last  test files are  that is the total your score is calculated by only the first  tests  after the contest all solutions will be rescored by the average of the scores of the all  test files and it will be the final score  about generating tests at first we choose  or  or  or  randomly and each probability is    if we choose t here then the test case is generated by the following type t  type  n is chosen from   uniformly and randomly  if n is odd n is added by   then each ak is chosen from   uniformly and randomly and independently  type  n is chosen from   uniformly and randomly  if n is odd n is added by   then n real values y y     yn are chosen from   uniformly and randomly and independently  and each ak is set flooryk  type  a real value x is chosen from   uniformly and randomly and we set n  floorx  if n is odd n is added by   then each ak is chosen from   uniformly and randomly and independently  type  a real value x is chosen from   uniformly and randomly and we set n  floorx  if n is odd n is added by   then n real values y y     yn are chosen from   uniformly and randomly and independently  and each ak is set flooryk   author serejaadm editorial  codechef comproblemsseashuf tags                                   aug challenge greedy heuristic serejaadm                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
