 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef has fallen into the labyrinth fortunately chef found a map of the labyrinth  on this map the labyrinth is represented as an n × m grid of integers  the rows of the grid are numbered  through n and the columns are numbered  through m lets denote the cell in the ith row and jth column by i j  each cell of this grid belongs to one of the following three types  forbidden cell represented by   its impossible to enter or exit this cell  empty cell represented by   chef can freely enter or exit this cell but cannot use it to escape the labyrinth  exit cell represented by a positive integer x  chef can freely enter or exit this cell  moreover chef can escape the labyrinth if hes located in this cell and no more than x seconds have elapsed since the beginning  chef is able to move from his current cell to any nonforbidden adjacent cell of the labyrinth this action takes one second  two cells are considered adjacent if they share an edge  chef does not even know his starting location so he decided first to determine his chances of escaping from each possible cell  specifically for each nonforbidden cell chef wants to know whether it is possible to escape the labyrinth when hes initially at time  located in this cell  help chef — for each cell find out if its possible to start in this cell at time  and escape the labyrinth  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers n and m  n lines follow each of these lines contains m spaceseparated integers  for each  ≤ i ≤ n  ≤ j ≤ m the jth number on the ith of these lines describes the type of cell i j of the labyrinth   output for each test case print n lines each of these lines should contain a string consisting of m characters  the jth character in the ith of these strings should be  b if the cell i j is forbidden y if the cell i j of the labyrinth is not forbidden and it is possible to escape the labyrinth when starting in this cell n if the cell i j is not forbidden and it is impossible to escape when starting in this cell  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n m ≤   ≤ sum of n · m for all test cases  ≤   ≤ type of each cell ≤   subtasks  subtask   points   ≤ n m ≤   ≤ sum of n · m for all test cases ≤  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                                               sample output                            nnnby ynyby yyyyy ynyyy nnnyy yyyb ybbn yynn  author ★kefaa tester ★mgch editorial  codechef comproblemsllaby tags                                   priority queue heaps bfs                                                              data structures queues algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
