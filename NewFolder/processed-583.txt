  n cats and n mice are situated in a d plane  mota chuha wants to choose k number of animals in such a way that the distance between any pair of chosen cat and chosen mouse is minimized  distance between the same type of chosen animals doesnt matter  in other words suppose chota chuha chooses cats ccc     cm and mice mmm     mn then maximum of distancecimj should be minimized                 input     the first line of the input contains pair of integers  n and k        next n lines will contain a pair of integers denoting the coordinates of the cats       next n lines will contain a pair of integers denoting the coordinates of the mice  output     output the minimized distance  the output value must have an absolute or relative error smaller than e       constraints   ≤ n ≤  n ≤ k ≤ n  ≤ x or ycoordinates ≤  no two animals are at the same position  sample input                    output        explanation     doest matter how you choose a pair of cat and mouse will be at distance of square root of      author ★amitpandeykgp editorial  codechef comproblemsamcam tags                                   acmamr amitpandeykgp binarysearch matching                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages java c cpp pyp  submit
