 recently a renowned scientist chef discovered a planet  total trees on planet are nn and are denoted by xx and yy coordinates  chef defined strength of a tree of the planet as the number of distinct subsets of remaining trees whose convex hull can enclose the tree completely and strictly inside it  more formally let sxsx be strength of tree xx aa be any subset of given n−n− trees excluding the tree xx from nn trees and hh be the convex hull of aa  then   sxsx  total number of subsets aa for which hh contains tree xx strictly inside it  sum of strengths of all trees is assumed to be the total strength of the planet  chef has already calculated total strength of the planet now he wants you to calculate the total strength just for verification  chef knows that the total strength can be high so he wants you to calculate the total strength modulo       notesnotes   consider the planet as a very large dimensional plane    all trees have distinct coordinates and no three trees are collinear      input format  stst line contains nn which denotes number of trees  following nn lines contains two integer xx and yy denoting the coordinates of ithith tree   output format  a single integer denoting the summation of all sxsx modulo      constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤  −≤xy≤−≤xy≤   sample input              sample output    explanation let aa bb cc dd and ee  subset abcdabcd contains point ee inside  subset abcabc contains point ee inside  subset abdabd contains point ee inside it  rest all other subsets do not contains any point inside them  therefore summation of sxsx     author ★gaurav editorial  codechef comproblemsinqu tags                                   gaurav geometry inso sorting twopointers                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
