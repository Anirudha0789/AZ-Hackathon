  chef is writing some arbitrary strings as he is getting bored  after writing some strings  he thinks that his arrangement of letters is very dirty  then he is struck by an idea that he can play a game with those arbitrary strings   notenote strings are in form aabbbccdeefffff…   and so on  once the repetition of a letter is over  it cant be repeated again    abbcddddeefffabbcddddeefff validvalid     aabbbccbddaabbbccbdd   invalidinvalid asas bb isis repeatedrepeated againagain eveneven afterafter itsits repetitionrepetition isis overover he takes a string ss and then decides to modify the string such that it should contain all the letters present in it in ascending order of their repetitions  to do that he starts swapping the groups of letters    swaps whole ′aa′′aa′ with ′ccc′′ccc′  swaps whole ′ddd′′ddd′ with ′ffff′′ffff′  etc and cost of swap is difference in the frequencies of the letters getting swapped   frequencyfrequency ofof aa letterletter isis thethe numbernumber ofof timestimes thethe letterletter isis repeatedrepeated inin thethe string string  notenote   duringduring aa swapswap youyou havehave toto swapswap allall thethe repetitionsrepetitions ofof thethe selectedselected letterletter withwith thethe other other  supposesuppose stringstring isis aabbbcccddaabbbcccdd  ifif youyou wantwant toto swapswap aa andand cc swappingswapping occursoccurs likelike ′aa′′aa′ withwith ′ccc′′ccc′  thusthus afterafter swapswap  stringstring isis cccbbbaaddcccbbbaadd   find the minimum cost to attain such a string   input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   each testcase contains of a single line of input the string ss    output for each testcase output a single line which gives minimum cost to attain the desired string  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤s≤≤s≤   subtasks   points  ≤s≤≤s≤  points  originaloriginal constraintsconstraints  sample input          aabbcccdeffffggghhhhhii     aaaa     abbcccdd     aaaabbbccd  sample output                      explanation case−case−   first swap d with aa  and e with bb    then swap ii with ccc   then ccc with ffff       then ffff with hhhhh      thus total cost will  be   and the final string would be deiiaabbcccgggffffhhhhhdeiiaabbcccgggffffhhhhh    author ★mann editorial  codechef comproblemschfstr tags                                   dynamicprogramming easymedium mann observation sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
