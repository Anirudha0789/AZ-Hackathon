  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian   our chef has recently opened a new restaurant with a unique style  the restaurant is divided into k compartments numbered from  to k and each compartment can be occupied by at most one customer    each customer that visits the restaurant has a strongly preferred compartment p  ≤ p ≤ k and if that compartment is already occupied then the customer simply leaves  now obviously the chef wants to maximize the total number of customers that dine at his restaurant and so he allows or disallows certain customers so as to achieve this task  you are to help him with this    given a list of n customers with their arrival time departure time and the preferred compartment you need to calculate the maximum number of customers that can dine at the restaurant   input  the first line contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  each of the next t lines contains two integers n and  k  the number of customers that plan to visit the chefs restaurant and the number of compartments the restaurant is divided into respectively  each of the next n lines contains three integers si fi and pi  the arrival time departure time and the strongly preferred compartment of the ith customer respectively    note that the ith customer wants to occupy the pith compartment from si fi  i e the ith customer leaves just before   fi so that another customer can occupy that compartment from   fi onwards   output  for every test case print in a single line the maximum number of customers that dine at the restaurant   constraints   ≤  t ≤        ≤ n  ≤      ≤  k  ≤      ≤  si  fi ≤       ≤  pi ≤  k                           sample input                                                                               sample output                              explanation example case   all three customers want different compartments and hence all  can be accommodated    example case   if we serve the st nd and th customers then we can get a maximum of    author vivekadm tester ★gerald editorial  codechef comproblemsfgfs tags                                   activity selection                                                              algorithms greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
