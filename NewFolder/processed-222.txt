 chef ciel wants to put a fancy neon signboard over the entrance of her restaurant  she has not enough money to buy the new one so she bought some old neon signboard through the internet  ciel was quite disappointed when she received her order  some of its letters were broken  but she realized that this is even better  she could replace each broken letter by any letter she wants  so she decided to do such a replacement that the resulting signboard will contain the word chef as many times as possible  we can model the signboard as a string s having capital letters from a to z inclusive and question marks   letters in the string indicate the intact letters at the signboard while question marks indicate broken letters  so ciel will replace each question mark with some capital letter and her goal is to get the string that contains as many substrings equal to chef as possible  if there exist several such strings she will choose the lexicographically smallest one  note   the string s  s   sn has the substring chef if for some i we have sisisisi  chef  the number of times chef is the substring of s is the number of those i for which sisisisi  chef  note   the string a  a   an is called lexicographically smaller than the string b  b   bn if there exists k from  to n inclusive such that ai  bi for i       k and ak  bk  in particular a is lexicographically smaller than b if a  b  we compare capital letters by their positions in the english alphabet  so a is the smallest letter b is the second smallest letter     z is the largest letter   input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the only line of each test case contains a string s  output for each test case output a single line containing the content of the signboard chef ciel will come up with  that is you should output the lexicographically smallest string that could be obtained from the input string by replacing all its question marks by some capital letters and having as many substrings equal to chef as possible  constraints  ≤ t ≤  ≤ length of s ≤ each character in s is either a capital letter from a to z inclusive or the question mark                            sample input                             cielise cielisourf tkeitesy  c                          sample output                            chefcielisachef chefcielisourchef takeiteasy chefchef aaachef explanation example case   here the resulting string can have at most  substrings equal to chef  for example some possible such strings are chefcielisachef chefcielisqchef chefcieliszchef however lexicographically smallest one is the first one  example case   here the resulting string cannot have chef as its substring  therefore you must simply output the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from the given one by replacing question marks with capital letters   author hirotoadm tester ★antonlunyov editorial  codechef comproblemsmanychef tags                                   string greedy                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
