 anjali loves food and she loves to cook  with time she has mastered the art of transforming a cooked dish into another one  a dish can be represented as a string where the ingredients are denoted by upper case english alphabets and the order of ingredients does matter  she has already cooked a dish aa which she wants to transform to another dish bb  there are three types operations which she can perform any number of times including  and in any order on dish aa to make dish bb  drop an ingredient free of cost  add an ingredient at the end with unit cost  swap a pair of ingredients free of cost   can you help her determine the minimum possible cost to make dish bb from her dish aa input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains the string aa  the second line contains the string bb   output for each test case print a single line containing an integer denoting the minimum possible cost to cook dish bb from dish aa  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤ab≤≤ab≤ aa denotes the length of string aa both the strings contain only upper case english alphabets  subtasks   points ≤ab≤≤ab≤  points original constraints  sample input  abc abccd  sample output   explanation  example case  she can first add the ingredient c at the end with unit cost and then she can add the ingredient d at the end with unit cost  since the ordering of ingredients of aa matches with that of bb after these two operations there is no need to perform any other operation  hence  is the minimum possible cost    author ★ankushkhanna editorial  codechef comproblemsdwwc tags                                   ankushkhanna ankushkhanna dwwu easy greedy observation                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
