 chef prepared two dishes yesterday  chef had assigned the tastinesstastiness tt and tt to the first and to the second dish respectively  the tastiness of the dishes can be any integerinteger between  and nn both inclusive  unfortunately chef has forgotten the values of tt and tt that he had assigned to the dishes  however he remembers the sum of the tastiness of both the dishes  denoted by ss  chef wonders what can be the maximum possible absolute difference between the tastiness of the two dishes  can you help the chef in finding the maximum absolute difference it is guaranteed that at least one pair tttt exist such that tts≤tt≤ntts≤tt≤n  input format  the first line of input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of testcases  the description of the tt testcases follows  the first and only line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn ss denoting the maximum tastiness and the sum of tastiness of the two dishes respectively   output format for each testcase output a single line containing the maximum absolute difference between the tastiness of the two dishes  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤s≤⋅≤s≤⋅                         sample input                                                            sample output                               explanation test case  the possible pairs of tttt are  and   difference in both the cases is  hence the maximum possible absolute difference is   test case  the possible pairs of tttt are     and   the maximum possible absolute difference is   test case  the possible pairs of tttt are  and   difference in both the cases is  and hence the maximum possible absolute difference is    author ★lavish editorial  codechef comproblemsmaxdiff tags                                   optimization problems case work conditional statements basic maths adhoc                                                              special basic programming concepts mathematics algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
