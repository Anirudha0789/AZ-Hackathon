 read problem statements in bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  the mex minimum excluded of an array is the smallest nonnegative integer that does not belong to the array  for instance  the mex of  is  because  does not belong to the array  the mex of  is  because  and  belong to the array but  does not  the mex of  is  because  and  belong to the array but  does not   you are given an array aa of length nn  you create a list bb consisting of the mexes of all subarrays of the array aa  formally for all pairs lrlr such that ≤l≤r≤n≤l≤r≤n you calculate mexalal…armexalal…ar and append the value in the list bb  find the kkth smallest value in the list bb  note since the size of the input and output is large please use fast inputoutput methods  input format  the first line contains tt denoting the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and kk  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an denoting the given array   output format for each test case output on a single line the kkth smallest value in the list bb  constraints  ≤t≤⋅≤t≤⋅ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤n⋅nxa≤k≤n⋅nxa ≤ai≤n≤ai≤n sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅   subtasks subtask   points  ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅   subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                     sample output                               explanation test case  mexamexa mexaamexaa mexaaamexaaa mexamexa mexaamexaa mexamexa  hence the list bb and the th smallest value in bb is   test case  the mex of all subarrays of the array aa is   hence the nd smallest element in the list bb is    author ★soumyadeep editorial  codechef comproblemsmexprob tags                                   d arrays binary search two pointers                                                              data structures arrays algorithms searching simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
