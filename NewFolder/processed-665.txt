  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  sometimes mysteries happen  chef found a directed graph with n vertices and m edges in his kitchen  the evening was boring and chef has nothing else to do so to entertain himself chef thought about a question what is the minimum number of edges he needs to reverse in order to have at least one path from vertex  to vertex n where the vertices are numbered from  to n  input each test file contains only one test case  the first line of the input contains two space separated integers n and m denoting the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph respectively  the ith line of the next m lines contains two space separated integers xi and yi denoting that the ith edge connects vertices from xi to yi  output in a single line print the minimum number of edges we need to revert  if there is no way of having at least one path from  to n print   constraints  ≤ n m ≤     ≤ xi yi ≤ n there can be multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices there can be self loops too i e   xi  yi                          sample input                                                                      sample output                             explanation we can consider two paths from  to        in the first one we need to revert edges    in the second one      so the answer is  min      author berezin editorial  codechef comproblemsreverse tags                                   directed graphs dijkstras algorithm bfs                                                              data structures graphs algorithms graph algos shortest paths traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
