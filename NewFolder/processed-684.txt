  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well   one day devu and churu were involved in a light discussion about finding the diameter of an undirected unweighted connected graph  diameter of a graph is the maximum value of pairwise shortest distances over all pairs of vertices of the graph  churu proposed the following algorithm which takes a parameter startvertex  algorithm startvertex tfind out the set of vertices s having maximum value of  ttshortest distance from startvertex  tans   tfor each vertex v in s tttemp   ttfor each vertex u in graph g ttttemp  maxtemp shortest distance between u and v  ttans  maxans temp treturn ans when devu heard this algorithm he exclaimed what this does not seem to be correct  churu challenged him to give a counter example to disprove the algorithm  you have to help devu come up with a graph as a counter example to the above algorithm if one exists  formally you will be given an integer n denoting the number of nodes of the expected graph counter example devu is producing  the graph should be undirected unweighted and connected  the actual diameter of the graph should not be equal to the one returned by the churus proposed algorithm    if for the given n there does not exist any such graph which could act as counter example print    input the first line of input contains a single integer t denoting number of test cases  description of t test cases follows  only line of each test case contains a single integer n as defined in the problem statement  output for each test case first line should contain the number of edges in the counterexample graph or  if no counterexample exists  if a counter example exists then print a single line containing an integer m denoting the number of edges in the desired graph print m lines each line should contain two integers u and v based indexing denoting an edge of the graph  you should make sure that no two edges in the graph repeat and that the graph is connected  in the next line print a single integer denoting startvertex based indexing passed to the algorithm  constraints  ≤ t n ≤  subtask there is only a single subtask worth  points with above mentioned constraints                                                                                                                                  sample input                                                        sample output                                                 explanation example case   there can be only one connected graph of  nodes  i e   is connected to   diameter returned by algorithm for any start vertex will be  which is equal to the actual diameter  so answer is    example case   please note that example given for n   is not a correct counter example  it is only given so as to clarify the input output format  in the example first line contains  denoting the number of edges in the graph  then  edges of the graph are given  the graph is connected  then the last line specifies the value of startvertex passed that is  to churus algorithm   author admin tester ★iscsi editorial  codechef comproblemsdevldisc tags                                   graphs adhoc observation                                                              data structures algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
