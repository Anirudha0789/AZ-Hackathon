 read problems statements mandarin  bengali  hindi  russian and vietnamese as well  you are given a sequence of nn powers of an integer kk lets denote the iith of these powers by kaikai  you should partition this sequence into two nonempty contiguous subsequences each element of the original sequence should appear in exactly one of these subsequences  in addition the product of the sum of elements of the left subsequence and the sum of elements of the right subsequence should be maximum possible  find the smallest position at which you should split this sequence in such a way that this product is maximized  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and kk  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the size of the left subsequence  if there is more than one possible answer print the smallest possible one  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for each valid ii  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                             sample output                             explanation example case  the actual sequence of powers is   the maximum product is ⋅⋅  in the optimal solution the sequence is partitioned into  and    author ★notsfast editorial  codechef comproblemsmxm tags                                   binarysearch easy ltime notsfast                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
