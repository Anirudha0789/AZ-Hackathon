  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef is working with lines on a d plane  he knows that every line on a plane can be clearly defined by three coefficients a b and c any point xxay lies on the line if and only if a  x  b  y  c    lets call a set of lines to be perfect if there does not exist a point that belongs to two or more distinct lines of the set  he has a set of lines on a plane and he wants to find out the size of the largest perfect subset of this set  input the first line of input contains one integers t denoting the number of test cases  each test case consists of one integer n denoting number of lines  next n lines contain  spaceseparated integers each denoting coefficients a b and c respectively  output for each test case output the cardinality of the largest perfect subset in a single line  constraints  ≤ n ≤ nmax sum over all n for all test cases ≤ nsmax a b c ≤  for a line with coefficients a b and c either a or b is not zero  subtasks subtask   points nmax   nsmax   subtask   points nmax  nsmax                           sample input                                                                      sample output                             explanation lines x  y     and x  y     form a biggest perfect subset   author ★cenadar tester ★xcwgf editorial  codechef comproblemsplanediv tags                                   basic maths geometry gcd                                                              mathematics number theory                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
