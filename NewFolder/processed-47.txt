 chef was recently watching modi jis speech and he had a perfect array of integers with him  a perfect array is one in which sum of odd index elements equals the sum of even index elements  as soon as modi ji announced the lockdown he was shocked and lost one of the elements in the array  so it is quite possible that the array is no longer perfect  he needs your help  you are given an array of nn integers  you need to add exactly one integer in the beginning of the array so that it becomes perfect  input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   first line of test case contains an integer nn  next line contains nn space seperated integers aa aa …  an−an−   output for each testcase output in a single line the integer value to be added at the beginning of the array  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ −≤ai≤−≤ai≤  sample input            sample output    explanation in case  after adding −− at thth index the array becomes −−      the sum of odd and even index elements are both equal to  now   author ★sahilbansal editorial  codechef comproblemseveoddeq tags                                   array easy mathematics mpcc sahilbansal                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
