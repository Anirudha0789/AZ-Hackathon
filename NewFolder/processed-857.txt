 sarthak has a set ss of nn distinct prime numbers  he grew very fond of that set and now he only likes a positive integer xx if all of its prime factors belong to ss  given the set and a positive integer mm can you find out how many integers he likes which are not more than mm note sarthak always like the number   input format  the first line of each input contains tt  the number of test cases  the test cases then follow  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm  the size of ss and the limit defined in the statement  the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers ss…snss…sn  the elements of ss   output format for each test case output on a single line the number of positive integers sarthak likes that is not more than mm   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤si≤si ss has nn distinct prime numbers                         sample input                                                          sample output                             explanation  test case  sarthak likes the numbers    and     author ★visheshs editorial  codechef comproblemsprimesetmul tags                                   binarysearch bruteforce easymedium exun math sorting visheshs                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
