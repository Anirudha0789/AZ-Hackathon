  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef has two piles of stones with him one has n stones and the other has n stones  fired up by boredom he invented a game with the two piles   before the start of the game chef chooses an integer m  in the jth move   he chooses a number xj such that  ≤ xj ≤ m and removes xj stones from both the piles this is only possible when both the piles have ≥ xj stones   the number chosen must be unique over all the moves in the game  that is for all k  j xj ≠ xk  the game stops when chef is unable to make any more moves  chef wants to make the moves in such a way that the sum of the number of stones remaining in the two piles is minimized  please help chef find this   input the first line of input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  each test case consists of  line with three integers — n n and m — separated by single spaces  output for each test case output a single line containing the minimum sum of the number of stones of two piles  constraints subtask    pts  ≤ t ≤   ≤ m ≤   ≤ n n ≤  subtask    pts  ≤ t ≤   ≤ m ≤   ≤ n n ≤  subtask    pts  ≤ t ≤   ≤ m ≤   ≤ n n ≤                          sample input                                                               sample output                               explanation example case    remove  stone from each of the piles  now  stones are remaining so chef cannot remove any more stones from the piles  hence answer is    example case    again remove  stone from both the piles to get  stones  now chef cannot remove any more stones from pile  so he stops  hence answer is     example case    first remove  stone from both the piles to get  stones  now remove  stones from both the piles so that  stones are remaining  now chef cannot remove any more stones owing to the condition that he cannot remove the same number of stones twice  so the answer is      author ★tapasjain tester ★xcwgf editorial  codechef comproblemschefst tags                                   ap                                                              mathematics sequences and progression                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
