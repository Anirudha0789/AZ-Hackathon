 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and bengali as well  there are nn chocolates and you are given an array of nn numbers where the iith number aiai is the flavour type of the iith chocolate  sebrina wants to eat as many different types of chocolates as possible but she also has to save at least xx number of chocolates for her little brother   find the maximum possible number of distinct flavour types sebrina can have  input the first line contains an integer tt  the number of test cases  the first line of each test case consists of two integers nn xx  the number of chocolates sabrina has and the number of chocolates she has to save for her brother respectively  the second line contains nn integers a…ana…an where the iith chocolate has type aiai  output for each test case output a single integer denoting the maximum possible number of distinct chocolate flavours sabrina can eat  constraints ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤x≤n≤⋅≤x≤n≤⋅  ≤ai≤≤ai≤ sum of nn over all test cases do not exceed ⋅⋅                          sample input                                                                       sample output                               explanation test case  in the first case the maximum number of chocolates sebrina can have is  as she has to leave  chocolate for her brother  thus the maximum number of distinct chocolates is also   test case  sebrina has to leave  chocolates for her brother  she can eat any  chocolates  since all the chocolates have the same flavor it does not matter which chocolates she eats  the maximum number of distinct chocolates would be   test case  sebrina needs to save  chocolates for her brother  she can eat any  chocolates  to maximize the number of distinct chocolates she can eat chocolates  and  with flavors  and  respectively  thus maximum number of distinct chocolates is    author ★lazywitt editorial  codechef comproblemscm tags                                   greedy                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
