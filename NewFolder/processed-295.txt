 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  to heal people with virus infections ada designed small robots nanobots that travel through the bloodstream scanning all tissues of the body  the nanobots have detected a region of infected cells described by a matrix with nn rows numbered  through nn from top to bottom and nn columns numbered  through nn from left to right  for each valid rr and cc the cell in row rr and column cc has a membrane with thickness trctrc  to prevent the spread of the virus the nanobots surrounded the infected region and decided to destroy all the infected cells  the nanobots can form a powerful laser with force ff and shoot this laser horizontally from the left or from the right of any row or vertically from the top or from the bottom of any column  whenever the laser is fired it breaks through the maximum number of cells in its way such that the total thickness of these cells membranes is less than or equal to ff and destroys them the cells that lie behind them are unaffected  formally if the laser destroys cc cells then they are the first cc cells which lie in the lasers way from the direction in which it is fired havent been destroyed before and the sum of thicknesses of their membranes is at most ff  the laser may be fired multiple times from any directions in any rows or columns  it may also be fired repeatedly in the same direction and the same row or column  however each shot uses a lot of the nanobots energy so ada wants to destroy all cells using as few shots as possible  let hh be the minimum number of shots needed to destroy all cells when using only horizontal shots and vv the minimum number of shots needed to destroy all cells when using only vertical shots  ada programmed the nanobots to perform kminvhkminvh shots  help ada write a program that uses a strictly smaller number of shots  input  the first line of the input contains two spaceseparated integers nn and ff  nn lines follow  for each valid ii the iith of these lines contains nn spaceseparated integers titi…tintiti…tin  the last line contains a single integer kk   output first print a line containing a single integer ss ksks ― the number of shots you want to make  then print ss lines describing the shots  each of these lines should contain a character xx followed by a space and an integer yy  xx can be l r u or d denoting a laser fired from the left right up or down respectively  if xx is l or r then yy denotes the row in which the laser is fired otherwise yy denotes the column in which the laser is fired  constraints  nfnf ≤tij≤f≤tij≤f for each valid ijij there is a solution that uses less than kk shots  example input                     example output  l  u  d  u  d  l  r   explanation the shots and the state of the grid in between the shots are shown below  the positions of the laser in the shots are denoted by  and destroyed cells are denoted by x   l        u        d                   x x     x x x    x x x           x      x x          x      x x                 x                               u        d        l       x x x    x x x    x x x    x x x   x x x x   x x x x   x x x   x x x x   x x x x     x   x   x  x x x x              test generation  let zffffzffff  for each pair of elements lrlr of zz such that lrlr except ffff there is one test file that uses these parameters ll and rr to generate the matrix tt  for each valid ii and jj tijtij is chosen uniformly randomly between ll and rr inclusive   scoring if s≥ks≥k you will receive the wrong answer verdict otherwise the score of a test file is k−sk−s  the score of a submission is the sum of scores of all test files  your goal is to maximise the score of your submission  there are nine test files  during the contest the displayed score will account for exactly  test files i e  your score reflects your submissions performance on approximately   of the test files  however if your program gets a nonac verdict on any test file your submissions verdict will be nonac  in other words an ac verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files  after the end of the contest your score will be changed to include the sum of your programs scores over the other  test files   author ★alei editorial  codechef comproblemsnbots tags                                   alei alei challengeproblem dynamicprogramming greedy may                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
