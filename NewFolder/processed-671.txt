 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef has a simple undirected graph with nn vertices numbered  through nn and mm edges  he wants to divide it into kk parts subgraphs for some integer kk  first chef divides the vertices in the graph into kk sets such that each vertex belongs to exactly one set the subgraphs and sets are numbered  through kk such that for each valid ii vertices from the iith set belong to the iith subgraph  then chef checks all the edges in the graph  for an edge connecting vertices uu and vv if uu and vv are both in the iith set then this edge belongs to the iith subgraph  otherwise this edge does not belong to any of these kk subgraphs  at the end chef checks these kk subgraphs  if each subgraph contains an even number of edges then chef thinks that this way of dividing the graph is delicious  chef wants to divide the graph in a delicious way such that kk is the smallest possible  find the minimum kk and one such way to divide the graph  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm  each of the next mm lines contains two spaceseparated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge   output for each test case print two lines  the first of these lines should contain a single integer ― the minimum kk  the second line should contain nn spaceseparated integers where for each valid ii the iith integer denotes the subgraph that vertex ii belongs to  if there are multiple solutions you may output any one  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤u≠v≤n≤u≠v≤n the graph contains no duplicate edges or selfloops the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed  the sum of mm over all test cases does not exceed   subtasks subtask   pts ≤n≤≤n≤ subtask   pts original constraints                          sample input                                                                  sample output                                  explanation example case  subgraph  contains vertices    and edges  and   subgraph  contains vertices  and  but no edges   author ★aa editorial  codechef comproblemsevedg tags                                   observation                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
