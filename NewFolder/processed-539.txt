 recently social media has been flooded by fb posts tweets news articles about only thing  demonetization  a great debate is ongoing over it  most of the people discussing in social media platform usually tend to take sides i e  either they support the move or they not  there is such a group of n people who vehemently discuss about their views about this everywhere possible on any platform  the influence of a person is determined by the number of posts he makes  the more posts you make about your supportopposition more your influence  usually it is hard to determine whether a person supportsopposes the moves just by reading their posts as they will make some oblique references here and there often followed by a big digression into catdog memes and name calling as the final resort sometimes as a first resort too in rare cases  but you came to know from fb ai team that the people whose support this move behave slightly oddly  specifically fb team told that a person will be a supporter if number of divisors of the number of posts a person makes is an odd prime number  you are given information about number of posts each person makes specifically person i makes pi posts  a study about user behavior tells that noone likes to have same number of posts as the other persons as they consider it as a loss of their identity  so users make posts in such a way that no two persons have the same number of posts i e  all the pis  are distinct  you want to study the social media strength of users supporting the move  let k denote the number of supporters of the move  for each ith most influential supporter you want to find hisher rank in overall influence in the social media considering both supportersopposers   input the first line contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  t test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of people in the group on social media  the second line of each test case contains n space separated integers pi denoting the number of posts made by ith person  output for each test case output a single line containing k space separated integers where ith of them denotes the overall influence rank of ith most influential supporter  if k is zero output no supporter found  without quotes instead  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ pi ≤  sum of n over all test case ≤   example input         output no supporter found    explanation example case   there are two persons on the social media group  you can see that first person has made  post  as number of divisors of  are  which is odd but not a prime so first person is a opposer of demonetization move  second person is also opposer of the move as number of divisors of  are   and  which is even  as there is no supporter so the output should be  no supporter found   example case   number of divisors of  are  which are even  so person  is a opposer of the move  number of divisors of  are    which is   as  is an odd and prime number person  is a supporter of the move  now we want to find the overall influence ranking of person   we see that person  has higher number of posts than person   so influence rank of person  will be    author admin editorial  codechef comproblemsamrc tags                                   admin amr binarysearch easy icpc sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp  submit
