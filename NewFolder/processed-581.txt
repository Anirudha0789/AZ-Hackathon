 xa  chef has a nondecreasing array a of n elements  since chef was getting bored in his holidays he was wondering how many subarrays exist in the array such that the arithmetic mean avergae of the subarray is less than the integer k  as the number of such subarrays can be a lot chef is asking for your help to exhaust his curiosity    a subarray is a contiguous part of an array  a single element is also considered a subarray  for example   and    are some of the subarrays of       two subarrays are different if their start orand end indices are different    xa input the first line of each test case contains two integers n and k  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers in nondecreasing order a a     an denoting the elements of the array   output output one integer the number of subarrays who has mean strictly less than k  note that this number exceed the maximum of what a c integer can hold   subtasks   ≤ ai ≤  for all subtasks  subtask  points all numbers in the array are the same subtask  points  ≤ n ≤   ≤ k ≤  subtask  points  ≤ n ≤   ≤ k ≤    example input          output   xa explanation  the subarrays are                          author ★adhyyan editorial  codechef comproblemsmeanarr tags                                   adhyyan array binarysearch icop standardtemplatelibrary twopointers                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp pypy js  submit
