  problem   you are going to your college via bikescootercar  you need to increase your speed to reach the college as soon as possible  your speed right now is divided into nn parts with their values sisi given  you can increase your speed xx number of times by increasing any value by sisi  consider floor value if the speed is odd  you always try to increase the speed very few times and speed to be high    you cant change the speed more than nn times and cant change the same speed again  finally you need to maintain the total speed  ≥≥ to reach the college on time  print minimum number of times you need to change the speed total speed yes if you can reach the college on time else no   input  firstline contains tt denoting number of test cases   next tt lines contains nn  along with sisi values as described above separated by space   output  for every case print the minimum number of times you need to change the speed total speed yes if you can reach the college on time else no  separated by space in a single line   constraints  tt nn sisi  sample input               sample output    no   yes  explanation in the first case hisher speed got divided into  speeds as      even though he increased all the speeds as described his total speed is still  which is not sufficient to reach the college on time     in the second case heshe increases  as described total speed became maximum and it is more than the required speed to reach the college on time                                                                                      author ★charann editorial  codechef comproblemsreachcmr tags                                   charann easy sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
