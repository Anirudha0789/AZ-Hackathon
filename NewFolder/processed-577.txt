 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef has a tree with n nodes  each node of the tree has an integer weight associated with it  lets define the cost of a sequence of numbers as the arithmetic mean of all elements of the sequence  next lets define the cost of a path in the tree as the cost of the sequence of weights of all nodes belonging to the path  its possible for a path to contain only one node  a set of paths in the tree is called a correct path decomposition if each node of the tree belongs to exactly one of the paths from this set  the cost of a correct decomposition is defined as the minimum of costs of all paths in this decomposition  chef would like to find the maximum cost of a correct decomposition  can you help him input  the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer n  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an denoting the weights of nodes of the tree  each of the following n lines contains two spaceseparated integers x and y denoting an edge between nodes x and y   output for each test case print the maximum possible cost among all correct decompositions  you answer will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤   ≤ ai ≤   subtasks  subtask   points time limit  second   ≤ n ≤   ≤ sum of n over all testcases ≤   for each i   i ≤ n there is an edge connecting nodes i and i  subtask   points time limit  second   ≤ n ≤   ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤   subtask   points time limit  seconds original constraints  example input t                      output        explanation   example case  its better to use one path containing both nodes blue in the picture above rather than keep each node in a separate onenode path since the first way gives decomposition cost equal to a  a          while the second one gives decomposition cost mina   a    min         example case  its optimal to decompose the tree into three paths coloured red green and yellow in the picture  this way the red path has cost a  a  a                  the green path has cost a   and the yellow path has cost a    thus the cost of this decomposition is    its possible to merge the green and yellow paths into one path with cost   without changing the decomposition cost  any other decomposition has smaller cost  note the multiplier for python has been decreased from  to    author ★kefaa tester ★mgch editorial  codechef comproblemslavg tags                                   dp on trees dfs binary search                                                              advanced algorithms advanced dp algorithms graph algos traversals searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit    secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
