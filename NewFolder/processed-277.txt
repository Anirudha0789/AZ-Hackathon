  read problems statements in mandarin chinese and russian as well   alice and bob are playing the game  initially there is a single rooted tree  players take turns alternately alice starts  in a single turn alice should choose any nonempty subset of roots of tree or trees and remove them  on the other hand bob should choose any nonempty subset of leafs and remove them from the tree or trees  please note that bob always takes some of the deepest in the original tree leafs  its not allowed to skip the turn  the game ends when a player cant take a turn  the alices goal is to minimize the number of turns made by the both players while bob wants this number to be the maximal  considering they both play optimally what is the number of turns eventually made  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of nodes of the tree   the next n lines contain pairs of nodes numbers ui and vi one pair per line denoting the edges of the tree   the nodes are numbered from  to n inclusive and the node with the index  is the root of the tree   output for each test case output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ ui vi ≤ n  xa example input                    output      author ★witaliyadm tester ★xcwgf editorial  codechef comproblemstreegame tags                                   bfs game theory                                                              algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
