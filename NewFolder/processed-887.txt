 phoebe starts her own fitness class  there are nn people standing in a row waiting to start their exercise  the ithith person is standing at point xixi where ≤i≤n≤i≤n  the length of the hands of each person is fixed as kk units      each person exercises by raising their hands to the side  now phoebe wants the exercise to be perfect  perfect exercise is possible if there is no overlapping of hands between two persons when they raise their hands side by side  an example of perfect exercise is       and if the hands are overlapping then it is imperfect exercise  for example       if the hands of two people are only touching i e  if akb−kakb−k then this is not considered as overlapping  now you have to output if the given set of positions with hand length kk is perfect or imperfect    input the first line of the input contains a single integer qq i e the number of queries  then qq lines follow  each query consists of two lines  the first line of each query contains the value of nn and kk  the second line of each query contains nn spaceseparated integers denoting xixi which is the position of ithith person    output for each query output perfect in a single line if it is possible to do the exercise without overlapping  or else output imperfect in a single line  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ≤xi≤≤xi≤  sample input             sample output perfect imperfect  explanation in the second example the second and third persons hands will overlap  therefore it is imperfect   author recursionnitd editorial  codechef comproblemsphbcls tags                                   reco recursionnitd sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
