 read problem statements in bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  there is a large tree house in an unknown world  it is ruled by the great emperor kzs  it consists of nn nodes numbered from  to nn in which the people of that world reside  the nodes are organized in a tree structure rooted at node   you need to assign values to the nodes according to the wishes of emperor kzs which are as follows   the value of node  is xx  all immediate children of any node have pairwise distinct values                                     for every node with at least one immediate child the gcdgcd of the values of all immediate children is equal to the value of the node                                                                                                                                             the total sum of the values of all nodes should be minimum   the greatest common divisor gcdabgcdab of two positive integers aa and bb is equal to the largest integer dd such that both integers aa and bb are divisible by dd  print the sum of all values modulo   input  the first line contains an integer tt the number of test cases  tt testcases follow    the first line of each test contains two integers nn and xx  each of the following n−n− lines contains two integers uu and vv denoting an edge between nodes uu and vv                                  output  for each test case print the sum of values modulo    constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤  ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅  ≤x≤≤x≤  ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n and u≠vu≠v  the given edges form a tree the sum of nn over all test cases doesnt exceed ⋅⋅             subtasks subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                              sample output                              explanation in test case  we will give values    to the nodes   and  respectively  so the total sum will be    author ★zankanotachi editorial  codechef comproblemsthouses tags                                   priority queue gcd dfs                                                              data structures queues mathematics number theory algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
