 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  after a long duration of the painful torturous and tumultuous periods of capitalism in snakeland now the snakes have decided to adopt socialism  the houses in snakeland are arranged in a rectangular fashion of dimension n  m  the wealth of the snake in the house at cell i j is given by aij rupees  a bill has been passed for making a smooth transition from capitalism to socialism  at the end of each hour the wealth of a snake will grow and will become equal to the highest wealth that its neighbor had at the start of the hour  that is consider the maximum wealth among its neighbors at the start of the hour and this snakes wealth will become equal to that at the end of the hour  note that this increase in wealth will happen simultaneously for each snake  two houses are said to be neighbors of each other if they share a side or corner with each other  find out the minimum number of hours required for this transition  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two space separated integers n m  each of the next n lines contains m space separated integers  the jth integer in the ith row denotes aij  output for each test case output a single integer corresponding to the minimum number of hours required for the transition  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n m ≤   ≤ aij ≤   example input                             output     explanation example   the wealth of all the snakes is already equal  so no time is required for the transition  example   at the end of the first hour the wealth of snakes at cells    and   will change from  to   then the wealth of all the snakes becomes equal and hence it required a total of  hour  example   at the end of the first hour the distribution of wealth of snakeland will be as given below              after the end of the second hour the wealth of all the snakes will be equal  so the answer is     author admin tester ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemssnsocial tags                                   d arrays graphs multi source bfs                                                              data structures arrays algorithms graph algos traversals bfs                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
