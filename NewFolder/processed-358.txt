 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef works as a cook in a restaurant  each morning he has to drive down a straight road with length kk to reach the restaurant from his home  lets describe this road using a coordinate xx the position of chefs home is xx and the position of the restaurant is xkxk  the road has exactly two lanes numbered  and  but there are nn obstacles numbered  through nn on it  for each valid ii the iith obstacle blocks the lane lili at the position xxixxi and does not block the other lane  when driving chef cannot pass through an obstacle  he can switch lanes in zero time at any integer xxcoordinate which does not coincide with the xxcoordinate of any obstacle  however whenever he switches lanes he cannot switch again until driving for at least dd units of distance and he can travel only in the direction of increasing xx  chef can start driving in any lane he wants  he can not switch lanes at noninteger  xxcoordinate  sometimes it is impossible to reach the restaurant without stopping at an obstacle  find the maximum possible distance chef can travel before he has to reach an obstacle which is in the same lane as him  if he can avoid all obstacles and reach the restaurant the answer is kk  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains three spaceseparated integers nn kk and dd  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers xx…xnxx…xn  the third line contains nn spaceseparated integers ll…lnll…ln   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum distance chef can travel  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ≤d≤≤d≤ ≤xi≤k−≤xi≤k− for each valid ii xixixixi for each valid ii ≤li≤≤li≤ for each valid ii the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   subtasks subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                                            sample output                                explanation example case  chef can start in lane  and switch to lane  at the position xx then continue until reaching the restaurant  example case  chef can start in lane  and switch to lane  at xx  however he cannot avoid the obstacle at xx because he has not driven for at least  units since the last switch  example case  chef should start in lane  and then switch lanes at the positions xx xx xx and xx  this way he can reach the restaurant  example case  chef can start in lane  but he cannot escape the second obstacle at xx since the first obstacle at xx doesnt give enough space for chef to switch lanes   author ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemstwolane tags                                   easy greedy kingofnumbers ltime                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
