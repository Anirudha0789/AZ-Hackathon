  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  chef likes to play games a lot  gravity guy is one such interesting game  gravity guy is an arcade sidescrolling game in which the player controls gravity guy by tapping the screen to switch gravity  the objective in this game is to run as far as possible while avoiding being trapped by obstacles falling or flying off the screen  if hit by obstacles the game is over  chef is so addicted to this game that each night he dreams of himself being in the game as gravity guy  he has two lanes in front of him represented by two strings of equal length named as l and l  each of the two lanes consists of some clean blocks represented by   and some dirty blocks represented by   chef can start running from the beginning of any of the two lanes and cannot step over any dirty block    encountered during his journey  he has to complete his journey by reaching the end block of any of the two lanes  chef can use the following jumps to reach his destination  considering chef is at xth block of some lane   he can jump to xth block of the same lane  he can switch gravity quickly and jump to xth block of the other lane  he can switch gravity and jump to xth block of the other lane   you have to tell him whether he can reach his destination or not  if it is possible for him to reach his destination then chef is interested in knowing the minimum number of gravity switches required to reach the destination  input first line of input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  each test case consists of  lines  first line of each test case contains a string denoting lane l  second line of each test case contains a string denoting lane l  output for each test case print yes without quotes in the first line if chef is able to reach the destination followed by a line containing an integer denoting minimum number of gravity switches required to reach to the destination  print a single line containing the word no without quotes otherwise  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ l ≤  ×  where s denotes the length of string s l  l  subtasks subtask   points  sum of l over all test cases in one file it at most   only yesno response will be evaluated  subtask   points  sum of l over all test cases in one file it at most   subtask   points  sum of l over all test cases in one file it at most   only yesno response will be evaluated  subtask   points  sum of l over all test cases in one file it at most                           sample input                                                                             sample output                            yes  yes  no explanation  test  chef will start his journey from l switch from l to l and finally land up at last block of l by switching from l to l  therefore he requires total  gravity switches to reach the destination  test  chef cannot start his journey as starting block of both the lanes l  l are dirty and he cannot step over them  in subtask  and subtask  only yesno response will be evaluated  thus for example the output yes  yes  no is considered as a correct output for the example input   author ★matermind tester ★laycurse editorial  codechef comproblemsgrguy tags                                   aug dynamicprogramming greedy matermind simple                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
