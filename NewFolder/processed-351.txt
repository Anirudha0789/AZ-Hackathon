  read problems statements in mandarin chinese and russian as well  the much anticipated video game bico grid has been released  the rules of bico grid are very simple  the game field is a x matrix where each cell is either a blocked cell or a cell with some number of coins  for a regular player the look of the field seems pretty random but the programmer in you recognizes the following pattern the ith cell on the nth row contains cn i coins if and only if  ≤ i ≤ n all other cells are blocked  record cn i denotes binomial coefficient n choose i  the player starts from the cell situated at row r and column c in the matrix  the objective is to collect exactly g number of coins from matrix in several moves  there are some rules   on each move the player must collect all the coins from some unblocked cell in the current column  the rules of the game state that player mustnt be really greedy so the number of coins he collected must not increase  in other words if at some move the player collected x coins then further he cannot collect more than x coins in a single move  after each move the player is immediately moved to some cell of the column w where w denotes the current column of the player  if the current column of the player has index  the game ends  the game ends when player collects exactly g number of coins   you are given the description of the game  please output the sequence of moves that win the game collect exactly g coins it is guaranteed that if the player will play optimally it is possible to win the game  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  then t lines follows  each containing three integers r denoting the starting row c denoting the starting column and g denoting the number of coins to be collected  output for each test case output two lines  first line contains k the number of column visited before completion of game  second line contains k space separated integers the number of coins collected from the cells in the order they were collected  it is guaranteed that a solution exists  and if there are multiple solutions print any of them  constraints  ≤ t ≤  ≤ c ≤  ≤ r ≤  ≤ g ≤  example input            output            explanation example case   we first pick  coins from   then we pick  coins from  example case   as rd column contains  coins in cell   we pick it example case   we first pick  coins from   then we pick  coin from   and again we pick  coin from     author vinayadm tester ★gerald editorial  codechef comproblemsbico tags                                   advanced greedy combinatorics binary search                                                              advanced algorithms mathematics algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
