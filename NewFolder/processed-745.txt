 chefs from all over the globe gather each year for an international convention  each chef represents some country  please note that more than one chef can represent a country  each of them presents their best dish to the audience  the audience then sends emails to a secret and secure mail server with the subject being the name of the chef whom they wish to elect as the chef of the year  you will be given the list of the subjects of all the emails  find the country whose chefs got the most number of votes and also the chef who got elected as the chef of the year the chef who got the most number of votes  note  if several countries got the maximal number of votes consider the country with the lexicographically smaller name among them to be a winner  similarly if several chefs got the maximal number of votes consider the chef with the lexicographically smaller name among them to be a winner  note  the string a  aa   an is called lexicographically smaller then the string b  bb   bm in the following two cases there exists index i ≤ minn m such that aj  bj for  ≤ j  i and ai  bi a is a proper prefix of b that is n  m and aj  bj for  ≤ j ≤ n the characters in strings are compared by their ascii codes  refer to function strcmp in c or to standard comparator  for string data structure in c for details   input the first line of the input contains two spaceseparated integers n and m denoting the number of chefs and the number of emails respectively  each of the following n lines contains two spaceseparated strings denoting the name of the chef and his country respectively  each of the following m lines contains one string denoting the subject of the email  output output should consist of two lines  the first line should contain the name of the country whose chefs got the most number of votes  the second line should contain the name of the chef who is elected as the chef of the year  constraints  ≤ n ≤    ≤ m ≤   each string in the input contains only letters of english alphabets uppercase or lowercase each string in the input has length not exceeding  all chef names will be distinct subject of each email will coincide with the name of one of the chefs                         sample input                              leibniz germany leibniz leibniz leibniz                          sample output                            germany leibniz explanation example   here we have only one chef leibniz and he is from germany  clearly all votes are for him  so germany is the countrywinner and leibniz is the chef of the year                           sample input                              ramanujan india torricelli italy gauss germany lagrange italy ramanujan torricelli torricelli ramanujan lagrange                          sample output                            italy ramanujan explanation example   here we have chefs torricelli and lagrange from italy chef ramanujan from india and chef gauss from germany  torricelli got  votes while lagrange got one vote  hence the italy got  votes in all  ramanujan got also  votes  and so india got  votes in all  finally gauss got no votes leaving germany without votes  so the countrywinner is italy without any ties  but we have two chefs with  votes torricelli and ramanujan  but since the string ramanujan is lexicographically smaller than torricelli then ramanujan is the chef of the year                           sample input                              newton england euclid greece newton euclid                          sample output                            england euclid explanation example   here we have two countries with  vote england and greece  since the string england is lexicographically smaller than greece then england is the countrywinner  next we have two chefs with  vote newton and euclid  since the string euclid is lexicographically smaller than newton then euclid is the chef of the year   author kaushadm tester ★antonlunyov editorial  codechef comproblemscvote tags                                   maps implementation                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
