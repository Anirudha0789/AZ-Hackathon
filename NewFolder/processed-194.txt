  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  n one dimensional kingdoms are represented as intervals of the form ai  bi on the real line  a kingdom of the form l r can be destroyed completely by placing a bomb at a point x on the real line if l  ≤ x ≤ r  your task is to determine minimum number of bombs required to destroy all the one dimensional kingdoms  input  first line of the input contains t denoting number of test cases  for each test case first line contains n denoting the number of one dimensional kingdoms   for each next n lines each line contains two space separated integers ai and bi   output for each test case  output an integer denoting the minimum  number of bombs required  constraints subtask   points   ≤ t ≤    ≤ n ≤    ≤ ai ≤ bi ≤   subtask   points   ≤ t ≤    ≤ n ≤    ≤ ai ≤ bi ≤     subtask   points   ≤ t ≤    ≤ n ≤   ≤ ai ≤ bi ≤                            sample input                                                             sample output                             explanation there are three kingdoms   and   you will need at least  bombs  to destroy the kingdoms  in one of the possible solutions you can place two bombs at x   and x       author snigdhaadm tester ★shiplu editorial  codechef comproblemsoneking tags                                   greedy sorting                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
