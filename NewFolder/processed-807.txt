 given an array aa of nn integers  you need to swap adjacent numbers exactly kk times  the goal is to minimise the number of inversions after exactly kk swaps  an inversion is a pair ijij such that ijij and aiajaiaj input  the first line contains an integer tt indicating the number of test cases  for each test case there are two lines in total   the first line contains two space separated integers  nn and kk  the second line contains nn space separated integers the ithith of which is aiai   output output tt lines in total  each line should start with case   and followed by the minimum inversions after swaps  here  is the number of the test case starting from   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ≤ai≤n≤ai≤n  example input                  example output case   case   case    explanation test case             test case       author admin editorial  codechef comproblemsacmkp tags                                   acmkgp admin easymedium fenwicktree segmenttree sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp  submit
