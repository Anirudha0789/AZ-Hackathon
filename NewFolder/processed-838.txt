  the aliens living in outer space are very advanced in technology  intelligence and everything except one and that is cooking   each year they spend millions of dollars in research to crack famous recipes prepared by humans  recently they came to know about khanaacademy  a nonprofit organization streaming free cooking lesson videos on earth   there are n recipes  numbered  to n and the video of the ith recipe is live in the time interval si ei   an alien can visit earth but can not survive for more than just a small moment earth is so advanced in pollution   an alien visits the earth at an integer time t and instantly downloads the complete video of all the lessons  that are live at that moment of time t and leaves earth immediately   you are given the visiting times of a small group of k aliens   find the number of different recipes aliens can learn by watching the downloaded videos   not just one group of aliens there are q such groups  so you have to find the answer for each of these q groups   input  the first line has an integer n   each of the following n lines has two integers si ei   the next line has an integer q the number of groups   each of the following q lines has information of a group of aliens   the first integer is k the number of aliens in that group followed by k integers in the same line  the integer visiting times t of the aliens   ≤ n ≤    ≤ q ≤   ·   ≤ k ≤   ≤ si ei t ≤   si  ei output  for each of the q groups output the number of different recipes that group of aliens can learn by watching the downloaded videos   example input                     output    explanation given videos of  recipes in the following closed intervals                               in the first query only one alien arrives at t   and can download  recipes      in the second query two aliens arrive at t   and   they can learn all the  recipes   in the third query three aliens arrive at t    and   they can learn only two recipes  and    author aniladm tester ★laycurse editorial  codechef comproblemsdownload tags                                   fenwick trees coordinate compression inclusion exclusion principle sorting range queries                                                              advanced data structures advanced tree structures advanced algorithms pre processing mathematics set theory algorithms queries                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
