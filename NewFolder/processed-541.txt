 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and bengali as well  two arrays aa and bb of size nn are equivalent if for every ijij ≤ij≤n≤ij≤n bibjbibj if and only if aiajaiaj  for example    are equivalent while   are not  there is a hidden array of nn integers where the elements are numbered from aa…anaa…an  your task is to guess any array which is equivalent to the hidden array by asking the following query at most qq times  the elements of the guessed array must be within the range   in each query you give a subset of indices ii…ikii…ik in the array i e some subset of …n…n and the judge returns the frequency of most frequent element among aiai…aikaiai…aik  note that the indices must be distinct and the order doesnt matter  for example consider the array    the ouput of query  is    occurs maximum number of times i e  times ouput of query  is   both  and  occur  times  interaction first you should read the number of test cases tt  for each test case you should read two integers nn and qq  then you may ask questions  output  followed by an integer denoting the number of elements in subset followed by the indices kii…ikkii…ik  read an integer xx denoting the answer to your query  if the query was invalid or you have exceeded the query limit judge prints  and exits with wrong answer verdict  in this case you must also terminate your program   when you have determined the answer print the character  followed by nn spaceseparated integers denoting the array aa…anaa…an  note that this does not count towards a query  now you must read an integer denoting that your answer is correct or not   if your answer is correct judge prints   in this case you should continue solving the remaining test cases  if your answer is incorrect judge prints  and exits with wrong answer verdict  you must also terminate your program in this case otherwise you may receive any verdict    constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ qnqn for the given constraints it is guaranteed that the answer can be found in the given number of queries   sample interaction you       grader                                                                                                      explanation the hidden array was aa     we ask a query for subset   the grader responds with  since both  and  occur  time  then we query for   the grader responds with  because frequency of  is   then we query for   grader responds with  since both elements are distinct  lastly we query for  and the grader responds with  i e frequency of     author ★anshugarg editorial  codechef comproblemsintereq tags                                   interactive problems constructive binary search                                                              special algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
