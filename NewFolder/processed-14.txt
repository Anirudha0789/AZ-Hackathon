 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well   you are given an array a with size n and a number k  lets call a position i  ≤ i ≤ n valid if after increasing ai by k it would be greater than the sum of all other elements in the array a   determine the number of distinct valid positions  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers n and k  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid positions  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ k ≤   ≤ ai ≤  for each valid i  ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤   subtasks  subtask   points sum of n over all test cases ≤  subtask   points original constraints                         sample input                                                                  sample output                              explanation  example case  a  k   isnt greater than a  a  a   so position  isnt valid  a  k   isnt greater than a  a  a   so position  isnt valid  a  k   isnt greater than a  a  a   so position  also isnt valid  a  k   is greater than a  a  a    therefore there is only one valid position — position     author ★mgch tester ★lg editorial  codechef comproblemszoz tags                                   d arrays arithmetic adhoc                                                              data structures arrays mathematics basic maths algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
