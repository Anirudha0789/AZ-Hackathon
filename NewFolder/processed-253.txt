 read problem statements in vietnamese bengali mandarin chinese and russian as well   you are given a tree with nn vertices numbered …n…n and an integer kk  a subtree is defined as a connected subgraph of the tree  that is a subtree is another tree that can be obtained by removing some possibly none vertices and all edges incident to those vertices from tt  a subset ss of vertices is called good if every subtree containing all the nodes in ss has at least kk nodes   find the size of the smallest good subset  input  the first line contains a single integer tt the number of test cases  the descriptions of test cases follow  the first line of each testcase contains two integers nn and kk  the next n−n− lines each contains two integers uu vv denoting an edge between vertices uu and vv of the tree   output  for each test case print in a single line the minimum size of a good subset   constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤n≤k≤n ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n the given edges for each test case form a tree  the sum of nn over all test cases is at most    subtasks subtask   points ≤n≤≤n≤ subtask   points original constraints sample input                             sample output    explanation test case  consider the set ss  the smallest subtree that contains both of the vertices in ss is the path between them →→→→→→→→ which contains  vertices  hence for kk the answer is   test case  consider the set ss  the smallest subtree that contains these three vertices includes  nodes    author srikkanthadm tester ★iscsi editorial  codechef comproblemssubtrcov tags                                   segment trees greedy dfs euler tour                                                              advanced data structures advanced tree structures algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
