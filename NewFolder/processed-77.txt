 given two equally sized arrays a and b of size n  a is empty and b has some values  you need to fill a with an element x such that x belongs to b  the only operations allowed are  copy bi to ai  cyclic shift b by  to the the right   you need to minimize the number of operations   input the first line contains a integer n the number of elements the next line contains n space separated integers where the ith integer denotes bi  xa output output a single integer the minimum number of operations  xa constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ bi ≤   xa example case  input     output  case  input        output   xa explanation example case   we can have  steps as   fill first element shift fill second element shift fill third element  a        b   after step  a       b   after step  a       b   after step  a       b   after step  a       b   after step  a       b    inputoutput data is large use fast io   author ★rounaqwl editorial  codechef comproblemsprcsb tags                                   array easy proc rounaqwl                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages java c cpp pyp  submit
