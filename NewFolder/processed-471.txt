  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  the chef has acquired a vicious bunch of snakes and these snakes are ever hungry and end up eating each other  in particular each snake i has a length li whose initial value is given to you  a snake can eat any other snake which is not longer than itself  that is snake i can eat snake j i ≠ j if li ≥ lj  and when a snake eats another snake its length increases by   that is li increases by   a snake can eat multiple other snakes  the chef doesnt care about snakes eating each other  all he wants is to have as many snakes as possible which are at least some particular lengths long  you are given q values k k    kq  treat each of them independently and output the answer for each  that is for each ki assume that you start out from the beginning with all the snakes alive and the lengths as the initial values given in the input and find out the maximum number of snakes you can get whose length is at least ki  input  the first line contains an integer t which is the number of testcases  the description of each testcase follows  the first line of each testcase contains two integers n and q which denote the number of snakes initially and the number of queries respectively  the second line contains n space separated integers l l    ln the initial lengths of the snakes  the ith of the next q lines contains a single integer ki   output  for each testcase output q lines the ith of which should have a single integer the maximum number of snakes the chef can get which are of length at least ki   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n q ≤   ≤ li ≤   ≤ ki ≤   example input                   output     explanation in the first testcase first query the second snake length  can eat the fourth snake length  and hence make its length   now there are four snakes left and their lengths are      so we have three snakes with length ≥  two snakes of length  and one snake of length   this is the best you can do  in the second query no matter what happens you cannot get more than one snake of length ≥   in the second testcase no matter what happens you cannot get any snake of length ≥   hence the answer is    author admin tester ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemssnakeeat tags                                   d arrays sliding window sorting binary search                                                              data structures arrays algorithms greedy searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
