 jj has a binary string ss of length nn  jj can perform the following operation on ss  select an ii such that ≤i≤n≤i≤n and flip sisi i e  change  to  and  to   jj wants to minimize the number of inversions in ss by performing the above operation at most kk times  can you help jj do so recall that a pair of indices ijij in ss is called an inversion if ijij and sisjsisj  input format  the first line contains a single integer tt  the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk  the length of the binary string ss and the maximum number of times jj can perform the given operation  the second line of each test case contains a binary string ss of length nn containing s and s only   output format for each test case output the minimum number of inversions possible after performing the given operation at most kk times  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤n≤k≤n sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅                         sample input                                                               sample output                               explanation test case  we are allowed to perform at most  operations  we can perform the following operation on ss –→→ which has  inversions  therefore  is the answer  test case  we can perform the following operation on ss –→→ which has  inversions  it can be proven that this is the minimum number of inversions possible  test case  we can perform the following operations on ss –→–→→→ which has  inversions  it can be proven that this is the minimum number of inversions possible   author ★jeevanjyot editorial  codechef comproblemsflipinv tags                                   april greedy jeevanjyot                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
