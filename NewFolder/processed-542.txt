 bob is moving soon and he wants to choose a truck that can hold a certain amount of weight  he knows the weights of all the items he is putting on the truck  can you help him determine the maximum number of items that he can put on a truck of any given weight you are given an array aa of nn integers the weights of the items  then you are given qq queries each of which is a possible weight of a truck  you must print the number of items that can fit on the truck each item with weight aiai  input  the first line contains two integers nn and qq  nn is the number of items and qq is the number of weight queries  the next line contains an array aa of nn integers the weights of each item  the next qq lines contain one integer each the weight of the truck   output there should be q lines of output the answer to each query  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ ≤q≤≤q≤ ≤qi≤≤qi≤  sample input                 sample output     explanation in the first query only  items can be taken for a truck with weight   these items all have weights   and   in the second query  items can be taken for a truck with weight   these items have weights      and    author ★samhenry editorial  codechef comproblemsfltrck tags                                   array binarysearch easy samhenry                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
