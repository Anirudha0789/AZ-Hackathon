 there are two groups one of nn boys and the other of nn girls numbered from  to nn  you are given two arrays aa and bb containing nn numbers each denoting the height of boys and girls in the group  you have to form nn couples where each couple will consist of  boy and  girl   each couple has a likeness value where  likeness value  height of girl in the couple  height of boy in that couple   you have to form nn couples in such a way that the maximum of likeness value of all the couples is minimum  note  no boy or girl can form more than one couple  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn number of boys and number of girls in the group  the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers denoting the height of nn boys  the third line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers denoting the height of nn girls   output  for each test case print the maximum likeness value in a new line   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤∗≤n≤∗ ≤aibi≤≤aibi≤  for all ≤i≤n≤i≤n                         sample input                                                             sample output                             explanation you can form couples of boy and girl with index pair   so the likeness value of the three couples will be   the maximum value will be  and there are no other ways that can minimize the maximum value   author ★adikrsingh editorial  codechef comproblemsvcouple tags                                   loops greedy sorting                                                              basic programming concepts algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
