 a little elephant and his friends from the zoo of lviv like candies very much   there are n elephants in the zoo  the elephant with number k  ≤ k ≤ n will be happy if he receives at least ak candies  there are c candies in all in the zoo   the zoo staff is interested in knowing whether it is possible to make all the n elephants happy by giving each elephant at least as many candies as he wants that is the kth elephant should receive at least ak candies  each candy can be given to only one elephant  print yes if it is possible and no otherwise   input the first line of the input file contains an integer t the number of test cases  t test cases follow  each test case consists of exactly  lines  the first line of each test case contains two space separated integers n and c the total number of elephants and the total number of candies in the zoo respectively  the second line contains n space separated integers a a     an   output for each test case output exactly one line containing the string yes if it possible to make all elephants happy and the string no otherwise  output is case sensitive  so do not print yes or yes   constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ c ≤   ≤ ak ≤  for k        n                         sample input                                                               sample output                            yes no explanation case   we can give one candy to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant and make them both happy  hence the answer is yes  alternatively we can give one candy to each elephant and left one candy for ourselves but they again will be happy   case   even if we give four candies to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant we will have only one candy left and can not make last elephant happy since he needs two candies for his happiness  hence the answer is no    author ★witaliyadm tester ★antonlunyov editorial  codechef comproblemslecandy tags                                   array cakewalk june witaliyadm                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
