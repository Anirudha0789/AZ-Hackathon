  coding in sprout a programming language is very intuitive  chef is giving his minions a demonstration in sprout and wants you to help him determine if they are not too difficult for them  a program in sprout is written using three kinds of instructions   load instruction load a value into buffer  increment instruction increment the value in buffer  print instruction print the value from buffer   the buffer stores a single integer between  and  both inclusive  if the value in the buffer is x the increment instruction makes the value x if x    at x   the increment instruction makes the value   load instruction can be used to load any value between  and  inclusive into the buffer  print from the buffer prints a lowercase english character based on the value in the buffer  precisely it prints the xth character in the alphabet  thus for x   a is printed x   b is printed and so on  for x   z is printed  to keep his programs clear he uses the load instruction only once in the beginning before printing any character  then he proceeds instruction after instruction  a program is simple if the number of instructions is not more than eleven times the length of the word that it prints  given the word chef wants his program to print and assuming he will write the shortest code i e  use the fewest instructions to print it will the program be simple  input  the first line contains a single number t the number of test cases  each test case contains  word on a line by itself  the word that would be printed by chefs program   output  assuming chef writes the shortest code with minimum instructions to print the given word output yes if this code is not more than eleven times the length of the word being printed no otherwise  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ length of word ≤                          sample input                             helloworld mississippi                          sample output                            no yes explanation  the optimal program length for mississippi is  instructions and that is smaller than  length of mississippi     author ★shilpadm editorial  codechef comproblemsnocoding tags                                   string arithmetic greedy                                                              data structures mathematics basic maths algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
