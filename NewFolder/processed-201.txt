 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  there are n hills in a row numbered  through n from left to right  each hill has a height for each valid i the height of the ith hill is hi  chef is initially on the leftmost hill hill number   he can make an arbitrary number of jumps including zero as long as the following conditions are satisfied  chef can only jump from each hill to the next hill i e  from the ith hill he can jump to the ith hill if it exists  its always possible to jump to a hill with the same height as the current hill  its possible to jump to a taller hill if its higher than the current hill by no more than u  its possible to jump to a lower hill if its lower than the current hill by no more than d  chef can use a parachute and jump to a lower hill regardless of its height as long as its lower than the current hill  this jump can only be performed at most once  chef would like to move as far right as possible  determine the index of the rightmost hill chef can reach  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains three spaceseparated integers n u and d  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers h h     hn   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the index of the rightmost reachable hill  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ u d ≤   ≤ hi ≤  for each valid i  subtasks  subtask   points original constraints                         sample input                                                                              sample output                               explanation example case  chef can jump to second hill because its higher by no more than u than first hill to jump to third hill chef has to use parachute   because its lower than second hill by  which is more than d chef cant jump to fourth hill because its higher than third hill by  which is more than u example case  all hills are of the same height so chef can reach the last hill with no problems  example case  chef cant jump to second hill because its too high for him  author ★kingofnumbers tester ★mgch editorial  codechef comproblemshills tags                                   greedy                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
