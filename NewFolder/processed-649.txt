 please note that the two versions of this problem differ only by constraints  the problem statement is exactly the same in both  you are given two strings aa and bb of lengths nn and mm respectively  find the maximum length of a substring of aa that is also present in bb  let this maximum length be kk  also find all such substrings of length kk that is present in both aa and bb and print the number of times each such substring occurs in bb   input  first line contains a single integer tt the number of test cases  first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm  second line of each test case contains two spaceseparated strings aa and bb   output for each test case output in the first line kk the maximum length of a common substring  then follows xx lines of output where xx denotes the number of substrings in aa of length kk that is also present in bb  in each such line print the substring of length kk present in both the strings and the number of times that substring occurs in bb separated by a single space  the substrings must follow a lexicographic order i e  you must first print the substring that will occur earlier in a dictionary than the others  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nm≤∗≤nm≤∗ sum of nn over all test cases doesnt exceed  sum of mm over all test cases doesnt exceed  all strings consist of lowercase latin letters only  sample input    pqfwkhopkmcoqh yggxxpklorellnmpa   q bcnuvqhffbsaqxwp   rxsj owkkyhiddqscdxrjmowf   drrwso qfjmafa   sample output  pk   q   j  r  s  x      author ★sibasish editorial  codechef comproblemseqsbstr tags                                   binarysearch easymedium fcf sibasish sibasish stringhashing                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
