 read problems statements in mandarin chinese and vietnamese as well  lets call a string xx interesting if it satisfies the following conditions  xx contains at least kk pairwise distinct characters for any two characters cc and cc which appear in xx the frequency number of occurrences of cc in xx is equal to the frequency of cc in xx  you are given a string ss  compute the number of interesting substrings of ss  two substrings are considered different if they are located at different positions in ss  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first and only line of each test case contains a string ss followed by a space and and integer kk   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the number of interesting substrings  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤s≤≤s≤ the sum of ss in all test cases does not exceed  ss contains only lowercase english letters ≤k≤≤k≤  subtasks subtask   points ≤s≤≤s≤ subtask   points  ≤s≤≤s≤ the sum of ss in all test cases does not exceed   subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                             ababc                           sample output                             explanation example case  the interesting substrings are ab ba ab bc abab and abc   author ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemssbstr tags                                   frequency arrays string loops adhoc                                                              data structures arrays basic programming concepts algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
