  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef found a strange string yesterday  a string of signs s where each sign is either a   or a   let n be the length of this string  chef wants to insert n   positive integers into this sequence and make it valid  a valid sequence is a sequence where every sign is preceded and followed by an integer and the signs are correct  that is if a sign  is preceded by the integer a and followed by an integer b then a should be less than b  likewise for the other two signs as well   chef can take some positive integers in the range  p and use a number in the range as many times as he wants  help chef find the minimum possible p with which he can create a valid sequence  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the only line of each test case contains the string of signs s where each sign is either   or a    output for each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the minimum possible p   constraints   ≤ t s ≤   ≤ sum of s over all test cases in a single test file ≤   subtasks subtask   points   ≤ t s ≤   ≤ sum of s over all test cases in a single test file ≤  subtask   points  original constraints                          sample input                                                          sample output                                explanation here are some possible valid sequences which can be formed with the minimum p for each of the test cases                               author berezin editorial  codechef comproblemschefsign tags                                   string substring                                                              data structures arrays groupings                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
