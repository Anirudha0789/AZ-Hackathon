 a lot of guests have suddenly shown up at your house and you only have xx litres of cold water at yy° at the moment  due to fear of covid each guest brings their own bottle each of which already has mimi litres of water at cici°  each of these bottles has infinite capacity  if you add cool water to the ithith bottle the temperature changes according to the formula tfinalmi∗cik∗ymiktfinalmi∗cik∗ymik where kk is the amount of cool water you added   you wish to maximise the number of containers that have a temperature ≤q≤q  note it is guaranteed that qyqy  input  the first line contains tt the number of test cases  the first line of each test case contains four space separated integers  xx yy qq and nn  the amount of cold water you have the temperature of the cold water the target temperature and the number of bottles  the next nn lines of each test case contain two space separated integers  mimi and cici  the amount of water and its temperature in the ithith bottle   output print the maximum number of bottles whose temperature can be ≤q≤q  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤yciq≤≤yciq≤ ≤xmi≤≤xmi≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  sample input                 sample output    author ★kabirkanha editorial  codechef comproblemscoldpani tags                                   greedy kabirkanha snuc sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
