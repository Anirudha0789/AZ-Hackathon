 in the parallel world of competitive programming formally known as pwcp every coder has a   unique positive integer rating i e  rating    there are two types of coders  type   one who code in groups during a contest  type   one who code alone during a contest                  iron man being a genius tries to find out all the coders who code in groups during contests  let us consider a list of nn integers where ithith integer denotes rating of ithith coder of type  as aaa    anaaa    an  if a coder has rating xx he belongs to type  if and only if there exists atleast one element in aa for which gcdxaiaigcdxaiai holds true    because it shows that this coder helped the ithith coder in some problem   coders who do not belong to type  belong to type   your task is to find kthkth highest rated coder of type  and type   as it is a very simple task iron man gave you another task   consider the function given below              intxafintxaxxaintxayxaxaxaxaxaxaifxayxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxareturnxaxxaxaxaxaxaelsexaxaxaxaxaxaxaxareturnxafxaxxaxayxaxxaxayxaxaxaintxafintxaxxaintxayxaxaxaxaxaxaifxayxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxareturnxaxxaxaxaxaxaelsexaxaxaxaxaxaxaxareturnxafxaxxaxayxaxxaxayxaxaxa  let  xkthxkth highest rated coder of type  and xkthxkth highest rated coder of type   also  lminxxlminxx  rmaxxxrmaxxx  let us define glrglr as  glrflflflflfl       fr−rglrflflflflfl       fr−r  you have to report glr as well  since this number can be huge compute it modulo    also if there does not exist any kthkth highest rated coder of type  or type  then you have to print  −−              input  first line contains tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   each testcase contains two lines first line contains two integers nknk   second line contains nn space separated integers aaa     anaaa     an  output for each testcase if there doesnt exist any kthkth highest rated coder of type  or type   print −−  else print two lines   first line containing two space separated integers   kthkth highest rated coder of type  and kthkth highest rated coder of type   second line contains a single integer  glrglr constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤  ≤ai≤≤ai≤  product  of all elements of array in a single testcase aa does not exceed   sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   kthkth highest rated coder of both type  and type  doesnot exceeds  if it exist    sample input                          sample output                       explanation type  coders          as kk xx   type  coders          as kk xx   ll    rr   gfffffgfffff  author ★avenger editorial  codechef comproblemscocr tags                                   avenger binarysearch cros inclusionexclusion mediumhard                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
