 read problems statements hindi  vietnamese  mandarin chinese  russian and bengali as well  oh these difficult contests… in each contest there are so many hard tasks chef cannot solve  however he knows that he can only become a successful coder if he works hard  fortunately he has a problem in mind for training  you are given two positive integers aa and bb  you may apply the following magical operation any number of times including zero  choose an arbitrary positive integer dd perform exactly one of the following actions add dd to aa add d−d− to bb add d−d− to aa add dd to bb  chef is asking you to find out if it is possible to obtain abab  help him input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first and only line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers aa and bb    output for each test case print a single line containing the string yes if it is possible to obtain abab or no if it is impossible  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤ab≤≤ab≤  subtasks subtaks   points original constraints                          sample input                                                        sample output                            yes explanation example case  one possible strategy for chef is  choose dd add d−d− to aa and dd to bb after this operation aa and bb choose dd add dd to aa and d−d− to bb afterwards aa and bb choose dd add dd to aa and d−d− to bb afterwards aa and bb choose dd add dd to aa and d−d− to bb finally we have abab   author ★mgch editorial  codechef comproblemschftired tags                                   basic maths                                                              mathematics                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
