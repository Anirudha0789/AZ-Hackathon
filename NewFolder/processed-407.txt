 guruji says that gotchi is the answer to all of life’s problems  however sartaj knows how potent it really is    given the array of measures of different potencies in a gotchi solution a a… an  divide the array into p cups having non empty consecutive subarrays such that every element of array is included in exactly one cup  let gi be the index of cup to which ith element belongs to cups are numbered from  to p from left to right  the gotchi potency value of each cup is determined by following formula  ∑ai gi  given  a    −    and we can divide it into  cups in the following way  −        −   and   then the overall potency value is equal to  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅ – ⋅    calculate the minimum potency value that sartaj has to drink   input •    the first line of input contains n size of array and p number of cups  •    the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a…an output print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum potency value  constraints  ≤nk≤≤nk≤  −≤ai≤−≤ai≤  example input         example output   example input           example output   explanation input   the  minimum potency value is    cups contain cup cup  cup  then overall potency value is ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅   which is minimum achievable value in following case   author ★rohan editorial  codechef comproblemsgotchi tags                                   coha greedy implementation rohan                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
