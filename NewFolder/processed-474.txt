 you are given a string ss of length nn which consists of digits from  to   you can apply the following operation to the string  choose an integer ll with ≤l≤n≤l≤n and apply sisimodsisimod for each ≤i≤l≤i≤l   for example if ss then choosing ll and applying the operation yields the string s––––s  the prefix of string ss of length l≤l≤∣s∣l≤l≤∣s∣ is string ss…slss…sl  a prefix of length ll is called good if ss…slss…sl  find the length of the longest good prefix that can be obtained in string ss by applying the given operation maximum kk times  input format  the first line of input contains an integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the tt test cases then follow the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nknk  the second line of each test case contains the string ss   output format for each test case output in a single line the length of the longest good prefix that can be obtained in string ss by applying the given operation maximum kk times  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ∣s∣n∣s∣n ss contains digits from  to  sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅   subtasks  subtask   points original constraints                         sample input                                                                        sample output                                  explanation test case  there is no way to obtain zeros on the prefix of the string ss by applying the given operation maximum  times  test case  the optimal strategy is choose ll and apply the operation twice resulting in ss then choose ll and apply the operation  times resulting in ss  test case  one of the possible sequence of operations is the following  choose ll and apply the operation thrice resulting in ss  choose ll and apply the operation  times resulting in ss   choose ll and apply the operation once resulting in ss     author ★soumyadeep tester ★tabr editorial  codechef comproblemsprez tags                                   binarysearch easy ltime modulararithmetic soumyadeep                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
