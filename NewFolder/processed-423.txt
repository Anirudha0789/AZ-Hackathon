 xa  flippy the bird has a permutation p of length n while fluffy the squirrel has a permutation q of length n  flippy the bird wants his permutation to be the same as fluffys permutation  he can cut the permutation into several parts and rearrange those parts so that the resulting permutation is equal to q  he wants to cut the permutation into the minimum possible number of pieces  can you help him determine the minimum number of pieces he needs to cut the permutation into  xa input the first line contains a single integer n the length of the sequence  the next line contains n spaceseperated integers p p     pn  it is guaranteed that these numbers are a permutation of       n  the next line contains n spaceseperated integers q q     qn  it is guaranteed that these numbers are a permutation of       n xa output output a single integer the minimum number of pieces that flippy needs to cut to form fluffys permutation  note that if flippy doesnt cut the number of pieces is  xa constraints   ≤ n ≤   subtasks  subtask   points  qi  i for all i subtask   points  original constraints  xa example input            output   xa explanation example case  one can cut the permutation p into  parts      and then rearrange it into      which is the permutation q    author ★zscoder editorial  codechef comproblemsmco tags                                   cakewalk greedy zscoder                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit    secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java cpp pyth pyp  submit
