 chef found nn magical cards in his drawer  each card has a number written on each of its faces  he places all the cards on the table in a front faceup manner  chef denotes the numbers on the front face by aa   anaa   an and on the back face by bb   bnbb   bn  chef can choose some possibly zero or all cards and flip them then he will calculate the bitwise and of all the numbers currently in a faceup manner  now chef wonders what is the maximum bitwise and that he can achieve and what is the minimum number of cards he has to flip to achieve this value  can you help him find it input format  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  each test case contains three lines of input  the first line contains a single integer nn  the number of cards  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa   anaa   an  the numbers on the front face of the cards the third line contains nn spaceseparated integers bb   bnbb   bn  the numbers on the back face of the cards  output format for each test case print a single line containing two spaceseparated integers first denoting the maximum bitwise and possible and second denoting the minimum number of flips required to achieve it  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤−≤ai≤− ≤bi≤−≤bi≤− sum of nn over all testcases does not exceeds                           sample input                                                                           sample output                                  explanation test case  the maximum and is obtained after flipping the first and third cards achieving a configuration of  which yields a bitwise and of   test case  every possible configuration of the cards yields a bitwise and equal to   so to ensure the minimum number of operations chef performs no flip   author ★tejasp editorial  codechef comproblemscrdflp tags                                   bit manipulation greedy                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
