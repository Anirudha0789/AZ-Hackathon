  farzi coder wants to give a nice christmas present to his brother  for that he has brought n pairs of letters where each letter is either a or b  so the possible pairs are aa ab ba or bb  now farzi coders brother loves palindromes  so he decided to concatenate some of the pairs possibly all or none and form a palindrome  he wants the longest such palindrome possible  if there are multiple such longest palindromes possible he wants to give his brother the lexicographically smallest palindrome among them as the gift  since he is well farzi coder you have to help him build the gift  input     the first line of the input has the number t denoting the number of test cases       the first line of each test case has the number n denoting the number of pairs  in this case       each of the next n lines contain a pair of characters which are either aa ab ba or bb  output     for each test case output on a seperate line the gift that farzi coder has to build  note that the empty string is a palindrome  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤  each pair can be either aa ab ba or bb sample input   aa aa bb bb  ab ba ab     output aabbbbaa abba      explanation  case  the following palindromes are possible aa aaaa bb bbbb aabbaa bbaabb aabbbbaa bbaaaabb  of these aabbbbaa and bbaaaabb are of the maximum length  among these two aabbbbaa is the lexicographically smallest   case  the palindromes possible here are baab and abba   author ★balajiganapath editorial  codechef comproblemsamlpalin tags                                   acmamr adhoc balajiganapath greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages java c cpp pyp  submit
