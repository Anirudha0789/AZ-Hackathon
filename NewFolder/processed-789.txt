  read problems statements in mandarin chinese and russian as well  you are given a transparent threedimensional table the height equals to h and the base is a twodimensional table n∙m  the layers of the d table are numbered from  to h  each layer is a twodimensional table the rows are numbered from  to n and the columns are numbered from  to m  a pair i j  ≤ i ≤ n  ≤ j ≤ m corresponds to the cell at the intersection of ith row and jth column of a twodimensional table  we can paint cells of the threedimensional table but not more than tk cells on kth layer can be painted  painting of one cell on kth layer costs ck  your task is to find the minimum cost of painting the table thus that it cant be seen throught from the top there is no cell which is unpainted on every layer  formally you need to find a painting that for any pair i j  ≤ i ≤ n  ≤ j ≤ m there is a layer k  ≤ k ≤ h where cell i j is painted  if there is no such a painting then the answer is impossible    input the first line contains three integers n m and h  each of the next h lines contains two integers tk and ck  output the output should contain the minimum cost of the painting if there is one otherwise output impossible without quotes  constraints  ≤ n∙m ≤   ≤ h ≤   ≤ tk ≤  for each layer  ≤ ck ≤  for each layer                           sample input                                                            sample output                             explanation in the first example we should paint  cells on the first layer and  cells on the second layer                           sample input                                                              sample output                            impossible explanation in the second example there are not enough cells to paint the table properly    author ★kostyaby tester ★rustinpiece editorial  codechef comproblemspntng tags                                   cook easy greedy kostyaby sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
