  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  the physics teacher in tanus class is teaching concepts of a bouncing ball  the rubber ball that she is using has the property that if the ball is dropped from height h then it bounces back to maximum height hf  so after first bounce it rises up to maximum height hf after second bounce to maximum height hf after third bounce to maximum height hf and so on  the class has n children and the teacher wants to select two children such that when the taller child drops the ball from his height ball reaches a maximum height equal to the height of the shorter child after some possibly zero number of bounces  note that zero bounces mean heights of the two children will be same  given the heights of the children in the class heighti can you tell how many ways are there for the teacher to select two children for the demonstration note that when heights are same the pair is only counted once see first example for further clarification  input first line contains t number of testcases  then t lines follow  per testcase first line of each testcase consists of two spaceseparated intergers n and f  second line of each testcase contains n spaceseparated integers representing the array height output for each testcase print a single line containing the answer to the problem constraints for  points  ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ f ≤   ≤ heighti ≤ for  points  ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ f ≤   ≤ heighti ≤                           sample input                                                                sample output                              explanation in the first case the three pairs are child  child  child  child  and child  child   for the second case also the three pairs are child  child  child  child  and child  child    author ★piyushkumar tester ★xiaodao editorial  codechef comproblemsphysics tags                                   hashmaps sorting                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
