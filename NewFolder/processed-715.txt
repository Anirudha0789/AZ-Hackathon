  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian   there is an ancient legend in china called ranka  content taken from wikipedia t wang chih was a hardy young fellow who used to venture deep into the mountains to find suitable wood for his axe   one day he went farther than usual and became lost  he wandered about for a while and eventually came upon two strange old men  who were playing go their board resting on a rock between them  wang chih was fascinated  he put down his axe and began to watch   one of the players gave him something like a date to chew on so that he felt neither hunger nor thirst  as he continued to watch he  fell into a trance for what seemed like an hour or two  when he awoke however the two old men were no longer there  he found that his axe handle had rotted to dust and he had grown a long beard  when he returned to his native village he discovered  that his family had disappeared and that no one even remembered his name  so how could that happen well thats because the game go can played very long  lets first define the game go in this game we focus on the game played on a x board  it is a game played by  players   a plays black stone while b plays white  they play alternatively  a goes first   in each cell there can be  states empty having  black stone and having  white stone  if we link the same color stones which are neighbourhood xx  yy   we can get some connected component   we say a connected component is dead if no stone in it has an empty neighbourhood cell   in each move the player must put the stone on an empty cell or pass the turn  if this player put a stone following situation will  happen   if after this move there is at least one connected component of opponent dead then stones from these dead components  will be removed  in this case after remove all dead components of your opponent we can prove all your connected component are not dead   otherwise if there are at least one connected component of yours dead then this move is invalid  in order to avoid infinite loops there is a rule called no same state  the state of board can be expressed as a string with length   the first character indicate who is the next player then  character indicate the state of a certain cell  if after one move the game goes into a state that previously occurred then this move is invalid  you are given an integer n  please output a match that contains n valid moves for both player  you can find details for the rules in the judge program  here   input only line of input will contain an integer denoting n  output you must output n lines  if the player uses pass at that step then output   otherwise output the coordinate x y where  ≤ xy ≤    constraints and subtasks  subtask  points  n    subtask  points  n     example input   output                          examples  here are some examples  you can see the image at this link if itis not properly visible in your browser        author chenadm tester ★shiplu editorial  codechef comproblemsranka tags                                   gray code game theory constructive observation                                                              mathematics number system binary algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
