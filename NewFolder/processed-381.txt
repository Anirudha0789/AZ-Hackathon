 xa shibly loves sorting very much  he is always thinking of new ways to sort an array his friend swapnil gives him a challenging task he gives shibly an array and an integer k  the challenge is to produce the lexicographical minimal array after at most kswaps only consecutive pairs of elements can be swapped help shibly in returning the lexicographical minimal array possible after at most kswaps  xa input the first line contains an integer t i e  the number of test cases  t test cases follow  each test case has  lines  the first line contains nnumber of elements in array and knumber of swaps the second line contains n integers of the array   output print the lexicographical minimal array  constraints    t       nk         ai       example input              output             xa explanation example case   after swap     after swap      is lexicographically minimal than    author â˜…shakilaust editorial  codechef comproblemsausasa tags                                   aust greedy shakilaust                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
