 you are given an array aa having the values of all elements in range   of length n n  each index i∈ni∈n has an initial weight of wiwi units  you have to perform qq queries  the queries can be of  types  type      x type      v l r  type  queries ask you to increase the weight of all indices by xx units  type  queries ask you to calculate the total weight contributed by elements having value vv in the index range lrlr note use fast inputoutput methods  if you want to submit code in pythonpython  then submit the same code in pypy pypy   input  first line contains tt the number of testcases  each testcase is described as follows first line of testcase contains two integers nn and qq denoting the length of string and the number of queries second line of testcase contains nn space separated integers ithith of these represents aiai  for ≤i≤n≤i≤n  third line of the testcase contains nn space separated integers denoting wiwi  for ≤i≤n≤i≤n  qq more lines follow each line will contain a query as described in the problem statement  output for each query of type  print a line containing the answer for query constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nq≤≤nq≤ ≤aiv≤≤aiv≤ ≤wix≤≤wix≤ ≤l≤r≤n≤l≤r≤n the sum of nn over all testcases does not exceed ∗∗ the sum of qqover all testcases does not exceed ∗∗  subtasks  subtask   points ≤nq≤≤nq≤ subtask   points all elements of aa have same value i e  aiajaiaj ∀ij∈n∀ij∈n subtask   points ≤ai≤≤ai≤ and here are no queries of type  subtask   points ≤ai≤≤ai≤ subtask   points original constraints  sample input                                                         sample output        explanation sample case   initial weights are  stst query is of type  and the contribution of value  is asked  since it is present only at index  in the range  hence total contribution of value ww units ndnd query is of type  and the contribution of value  is asked  since it is present at indices  hence total contribution of value wwwwww units rdrd query is of type  which asks to increase the weights by  units hence the new weights will be  answer for thth query ww units answer for thth query wwwwww units   author ★mayureshpatle editorial  codechef comproblemscac tags                                   binarysearch mayureshpatle prefixsum                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
