  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  chef has an empty matrix of nxm  he wants to construct rectangle genome  for this reason chef should fill the matrix with letters g с a t  the genome will be stable if it contains k different submatrices  of course chef wants to make his genome as stable as possible that is the difference between the number of different submatrices in genome and number k should be as small as possible  please write a program for chef that constructs as stable genome as possible  note that you must fill each cell of the matrix  two submatrices is different if either one of their dimensions differs or for some pair of corresponding cells their content differs  input the first line contains a single integer t denoting the number of testcases  each of the next t lines contains the description of the testcase three integers n m k  output for each testcase in the first n lines print nxm matrix  each character of the matrix should be g c a or t  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ m ≤  test generation all the tests contains manual nonrandom n and m values  number k for each testcase was choosen uniformly from the range  nnmm  scoring imagine that your matrix for some testcase contains w different submatrices  your score for that testcase will be wkk  you score for all testcases is the sum of  the scores for each testcase  there are  cases in total and only  of them are evaluated during the contest while others are tested but scored  and will be evaluated after the contest  example input         output aaa aaa t explanation example case   in this testcase the output matrix contains  different submatrices  so your scoring for this testcase will be    author ★gerald editorial  codechef comproblemsgerald tags                                   challenge gerald greedy july                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
