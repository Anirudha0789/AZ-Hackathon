 read problem statements in mandarin bengali and russian as well  alice and bob have a permutation of size nn so they started playing a game on it  they both have their own copies of an initial permutation on which they perform moves in turns  note that although bobs and alices permutations are initially similar in values they are the not the same permutation any move alice makes only changes her permutation and not bobs and vice versa  alice goes first  in one move they can do the following on their respective permutations  choose two indices ii and jj and swap pipi and pjpj   the player who sorts their permutation first wins the game  both players play optimally  but unfortunately on playing a lot of games alice won all of those  bob realized that something is unfair and told alice to play with some handicap  so they mutually agreed that alice is given an extra potential array vv of size nn  now alice can do the following move only  choose two indices ii and jj such that vivi and vjvj  if no such indices exist skip her turn  else swap pipi and pjpj and then decrement vivi and vjvj by    bob plays as usual without any potential array  alice goes first  report who wins if both play optimally and find the strategy for the winner  you also need to determine the shortest sequence of moves to victory  input format  the first line contains tt  the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the size of the permutation  the next line contains nn space separated integers pp…pnpp…pn  the next line contains nn space separated integers vv…vnvv…vn   output format for each test case  output on the first line the winner of the match i e  alice or bob  you may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase for example the strings alice alice alice and alice will all be treated as identical  output on the next line an integer mm  the minimum number of moves taken by the winner  then output mm lines where the iith line contains two integers denoting the iith move by the winner   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤pi≤n≤pi≤n ≤vi≤≤vi≤ pp…pnpp…pn form a permutation of values from  to nn ∑n∑n over all test cases is at most                          sample input                                                                                                sample output                            bob              alice                 author ★anshugarg editorial  codechef comproblemssrtgame tags                                   sets greedy cycles constructive implementation                                                              data structures algorithms graph algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
