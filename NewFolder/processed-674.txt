 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  a directed tree is a directed graph such that if all edges were undirected this graph would be a tree  a rooted directed tree is a directed tree in which there is one vertex the root lets denote it by rr such that it is possible to reach all vertices of the graph from rr by moving along the directed edges  you are given a directed tree with nn vertices numbered  through nn  you may perform the following operation on it any number of times including zero  choose some edge which currently exists in the graph  remove this edge  add a new edge in such a way that the graph becomes a directed tree again   what is the smallest number of operations which need to be performed in order to make the directed tree rooted input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  each of the next n−n− lines contains two spaceseparated integers uu and vv denoting that there is a directed edge from uu to vv in the tree   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest number of operations we need to perform to create a rooted directed tree  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n the graph described on the input is a directed tree the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   subtasks subtask   points for each edge uu or vv the graph is a directed star subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                sample output                              explanation example case  we can delete the edge from vertex  to vertex  and insert an edge from  to   then the graph becomes a rooted directed tree with vertex  as the root  however there are many other possible solutions  example case  the graph is already a rooted directed tree the root is vertex    author ★antontrygub editorial  codechef comproblemsroottree tags                                   directed graphs adhoc                                                              data structures graphs algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
