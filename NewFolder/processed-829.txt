 read problems statements bengali  mandarin chinese  russian and vietnamese as well  you are given two integer sequences aa…anaa…an and bb…bnbb…bn  we define the similarity of the sequences aa and bb as the number of indices ii such that aibiaibi  you should process qq queries  in each query you are given parameters ll rr and cc you should change each of the elements alal…aralal…ar to cc and then compute the similarity of the sequences aa and bb  chef knows that this is simple so he asks you to answer the queries online  note that the input is given in a special format to ensure that  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and qq  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an  the third line contains nn spaceseparated integers bb…bnbb…bn  each of the next qq lines contains three spaceseparated integers xx yy and zz describing a query in the following format lets denote the similarity of aa and bb before this query by prpr for the first query prpr is the similarity of the initial sequences  for this query lx⊕prlx⊕pr ry⊕prry⊕pr and cz⊕prcz⊕pr   output for each query print a single line containing one integer — the similarity after this query  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nq≤≤nq≤ ≤aibi≤≤aibi≤ for each valid ii ≤c≤≤c≤ ≤l≤r≤n≤l≤r≤n  subtasks subtask   points ≤nq≤≤nq≤ subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                         sample output                               explanation example case  the similarity before any query is applied is  the sequences match at positions  and   in the first query ll rr cc  the similarity after this query is  the only match is at position   in the second query ll rr cc  the similarity after this query is  no match at any position  in the third query ll rr cc  the similarity after this query is  two matches at positions  and    author ★teja editorial  codechef comproblemsmatch tags                                   sets merge sort tree binary search                                                              data structures advanced data structures advanced tree structures algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
