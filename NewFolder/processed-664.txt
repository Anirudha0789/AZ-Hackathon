  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  leha is playing a very interesting game  the game will be played on a rectangular grid consisting of n rows and m columns  initially all the cells of the grid are uncolored   lehas initial score is zero  at each turn he chooses some cell that is yet not colored and colors that cell  the score obtained in this step will be number of neighboring colored cells of the cell that leha colored in this step  two cells are neighbors of each other if they share a side between them  the game will end when all the cells are colored  finally total score obtained at the end of the game will sum of score obtained in each turn  leha wants to know what maximum score he can get can you please help him in finding this out input the first line contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  t test cases follow  each of the following t lines contains two spaceseparated integers n m denoting the dimensions of the grid  output for each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximal possible score leha can obtain  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n m ≤    subtasks  subtask  points  ≤ n m ≤  subtask  points  ≤ n m ≤                           sample input                                                        sample output                             explanation leha can obtain total score  in the following way   in the first step he colors down left cell all the neighboring cells of this cell are uncolored  so it adds  to total score  in second step he can color upper right cell it also adds total  to the score  in third step he can color top left cell  there are two neighboring cell of this cell both of which are colored  so this add  to the score  in the last step he can choose the remaining down right cell  there are two neighboring cell of this cell both of which are colored  so this also add  to the score   leha cant obtain a score more than   hence  is the answer    author ★pavel tester ★karanaggarwal editorial  codechef comproblemsomwg tags                                   graphs observation                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
