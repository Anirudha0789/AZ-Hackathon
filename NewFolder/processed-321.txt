  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  mike takes part in olympiads in informatics  you think he is a rookie wrong he is an experienced and wellprepared competitor he participated in many important contests and won some of them  now his level is rather high    in order to keep fit mike decided to improve his training sessions  he downloaded n task packages  there are ai tasks in ith package  they are really interesting and complicated so mike wants to solve them all unfortunately it is going to be an important contest in a few days so mike can solve at most x tasks before it  lets assume that mike can solve any x problems before the contest  do you know what makes mike happy right successful packages a package of tasks is successful if mike solved all the tasks in it  do you also know what makes mike sad right failed packages a package of tasks is failed if mike solved less than a half of the tasks in it  please help mike to organize his training session mike wants to minimize the number of failed packages  if there are several ways of doing this he wants to maximize the number of successful packages  remember also that he cant solve more than x tasks before the contest   input  the first line contain two integers n and x  the second line contain n positive integers ith integer denotes ai  the array a is indexed   output the first line should contain two integers the number of failed packages and the number of successful packages in the optimal way of solving  scoring   ≤ x ≤  for each test case  ≤ ai ≤  for each test case  subtask   points  ≤ n ≤  a  a       an ≤ x subtask   point  ≤ n ≤  subtask   points  ≤ n ≤  subtask   points  ≤ n ≤   subtask   points  ≤ n ≤                              sample input                                                          sample output                              explanation  in the test case n equals to  x equals to  a equals to     it is optimal to solve all the problems in the first and the second packages and to solve  problems in the third package    author ★kostyaby editorial  codechef comproblemsmike tags                                   greedy sorting                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
