 read problem statements in mandarin chinese and russian as well  as you know there is a big problem in the educational system of chefland  impudent students who cuts in line in the cafeteria  chef wants to assess the problem  he was able to understand how the queue works  each student has value of discontent which is initially equal to  initially the queue is empty students arrive at the queue one by one  each student can either enter the queue in the end or textitcut in line by which we mean stand in front of one or more students already in the queue when someone cuts in line the value of discontent of every student who ended up behind the new one is increased by    for example if the students will enter the queue in the following order →→→→→→→→→→ the discontent of the students in the queue will change as follows →→→→→→→→→→ note that the values of discontent are given in the same order as students are in the queue in the end of the process not in order they were entering the queue  lets call the array of discontent values in the same order as students are in the queue in the end of the process textitthe array of discontent  chef notices that if one knows the array of discontent then it is possible to find out how many students cut in line  and then chef decides to make a competitive programming problem out of it you are given array aa…anaa…an  you have to process queries of two types  find the number of students who cut in line if the array of discontent is alal…aralal…ar  that is the subsegment of the array aa add a number ww to alal…aralal…ar  that is the subsegment of the array aa   you also have to find the number of students who cut in line using the initial aa as array of discontent  input  the first line of input contains one integer nn ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅  the size of the array aa  the second line of input contains nn integers aa…anaa…an separated by spaces  the array aa itself  the third line on input contains one integer qq ≤q≤⋅≤q≤⋅  the number of queries  then qq lines describing the queries follow  each line starts with integer tt  the type of the query  if tt then two more integers lrlr follow ≤l≤r≤n≤l≤r≤n  for this query you have to print the number of students who cut in line if the array of discontent is alal…aralal…ar  if tt then three more numbers lrwlrw follow ≤l≤r≤n≤l≤r≤n wnwn  for this query you have to add ww to numbers alal…aralal…ar   it is guaranteed that at any given time ai≤ai≤ and also that every time you have to find the number of students who cut in line the corresponding array of discontent will be consistent that is there exists at least one process which results in the given array of discontent  output in the first line of output you should print the answer for the initial array aa  then print answers for each query of type  in the order they are given in input  constraints  ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ ≤q≤⋅≤q≤⋅ ≤ain≤ain ≤win≤win  subtasks   points  ≤n≤≤n≤ qq  points  ≤n≤≤n≤ q≤q≤  points  ≤n≤≤n≤ q≤q≤  points  ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ q≤⋅q≤⋅                         sample input                                                                                                                 sample output                                             author ★fairywinx editorial  codechef comproblemshotmeals tags                                   lazy propagation square root decomposition binary search                                                              advanced data structures advanced tree structures segment trees advanced algorithms algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit    secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
