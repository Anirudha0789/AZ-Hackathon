 chef is in love with his girlfriend chefina nowafter being in relationship for so many years chef tries to propose chefina for marriage  chefina being a  mathematics lover gives a equation of manyone function to chef and put a condition that she will marry him only when he will be able to find the roots of the given function in a given range  fxx−k∗x−k∗x−k∗x−kcfxx−k∗x−k∗x−k∗x−kc chefina tells some specific points about function i e   the values of kkkkkkkk are integers and  given for each test file  in a given range lrlr there exists more than one roots of a function  in a given range lrlr there exists only either a maxima or a minima  the value of the constant cc will be given in each test case  chef has to print all the roots of a function in a given range   as chef is weak in maths he wants your help so that he can marry his love  input format  first line contain  space separated pairwise distinct integers i e   kk kk kk kk  next line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow  each testcase contains of a single line of input consisting of  space separated integerslrclrc   output format for each test case print all the roots of the function in increasing order in the given range containing space between each two of them such that aa aa aa          anan in increasing order i e if there are nn roots of a function in a given range  constraints  ≤ki≤≤ki≤ ≤t≤≤t≤ −∗≤lr≤∗−∗≤lr≤∗ −∗≤c≤−∗≤c≤  note you should round off your answer upto  decimal places answers with relative error less than  will be accepted  it is also guaranteed that the roots always exists in the given range  sample input           sample output    author ★valiantvidit editorial  codechef comproblemschlove tags                                   binarysearch chil easymedium valiantvidit                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
