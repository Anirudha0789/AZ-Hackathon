 factorial n or n is defined as below n     n for example       now if we prime factorize a factorial we will be able to find the frequency of each prime in it for example      so there are exactly four s two s one  and one  in   for factorials of large numbers primefactorization is not a good idea and there are many better ways to find out frequency of prime numbers it factorials of large number  now consider  numbers                and a set of consecutive prime numbers      nd rd th th and th and an integer  the frequency and you are asked to find how many of these numbers have one prime from the set of primes exactly two times  the answer will be  and these  numbers are shown below valueprimes that are present exactly  times            in this problem you are asked to solve a generalized version of this problem  given a set of factorials of consecutive numbers f a set of consecutive prime numbers p and an integer t you job is two find out how many of the numbers in  f contains any one of the prime numbers from set p exactly t times  but if more than one prime from p is present exactly t times in some number it is ok    input the first line contains a positive integer c c which denotes the total number of test cases to follow  each of the next c lines consists input for a single test case  each line contains five positive integers low high   low  high ≤  plow phigh   plow  phigh ≤  and t   t ≤   these numbers denotes that you have to deal with the set of factorial of consecutive numbers low low low     high high and a set of primes p which contains pplow pplow     pphigh  primes are numbered starting from  so p is actually  p p p p  etc  you will have to find how many of these factorials contains one or more primes from this set p exactly t times     output for each test case produce one line of output  this line contains at integer m which denotes how many of the numbers low low low     high high contains at least one prime from set p exactly t times  sample input             output     author koladm editorial  codechef comproblemskolc tags                                   sieve of eratosthenes binary search                                                              mathematics number theory algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp  submit
