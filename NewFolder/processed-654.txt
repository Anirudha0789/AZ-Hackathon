 problem statement geneo loves operating sysytems the most in computer science  while going to one of his lectures he came accross the following problem  most of you must be familiar with raid systems which are used to store data in hard disk in redudant form so as to recover data in case of loses  chosing which raid to use depends on use case like memory available frequency of data loses etc  some raid use complete duplication some use parity and so on  in this problem we consider our own way to store redundant data of hard disks  you are provided with n hard disk and n files each labelled from  to n  initailly each hard disk i contains the corresponding file i stored in it  after every one hour the hard disk take backup as follows every hard disk i copies all the files from hard disks state as in last hour which have id greater than or equal to it  i e  from i to n after this copying some files might occur multiple times in this hard disk  it deletes all the files which occur even number of times and stores only the files which occurs odd number of times  an example of the above process is below time hard disk  hard disk  hard disk  hard disk  hard disk   f f f f f  fffff ffff fff ff f  fff ff ff f f  fff ff ff ff f  ff f f f f  and so on where fi denotes that file i was stored in hard disk  also assume that files are stored in hard disk in sorted order of their file number  you need to support  type of operations  assume every hard disk has initially n slots where each slot can store one file each  in this space consious world we would like to know how many slots are available in hard disk x during the yth hour so that we can utilise this space for some other storage  retrieval of files in efficient manner is also very important  so we would like to know which file would be stored in the kth slot in hard disk x during the yth hour  in case that slot is empty report  as your answer  this will help us develop a quick mechanism to index files in the memory an important aspect taken care by the operating system  input section the first line contains  integers n and q denoting the number of hard disks or equivalently files and the number of queries to process  each of the next q lines if one of the following type    x y query of type  asking us to print the number of empty slots in hard disk x during the yth hour   x y k query of type  asking us to find the file number stored in the kth slot in hard disk x during the yth hour   output section for query of type  print number of slots which are empty in hard disk x during the yth hour  for query of type  print the file number stored in the kth slot in hard disk x during the yth hour  in case that slot is empty report  as your answer  input constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ q ≤   ≤ x k ≤ n  ≤ y ≤   sample input                         sample output        explanation for details refer to the table mentioned in the statement above   author ★likecs editorial  codechef comproblemsicl tags                                   binarysearch icl likecs likecs mediumhard observation                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
