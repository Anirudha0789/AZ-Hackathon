 read problem statements in mandarin chinese  chef organised a chess tournament which spanned over mm months  there were nn players and player ii was rated riri before the start of the tournament  to see the progress of the players he noted their rating changes at the end of each month  after the tournament fide asked chef to find the number of players whose peak rating and peak ranking did not occur in the same month  in other words chef was asked to find the ratings and ranking of each player after each of the mm months  then using this data he should find the number of players such that the month in which they achieved their highest rating over all the months was different from the month in which they achieved their best rank based on ratings over all the months  note that we do not consider the initial ratingranking but only the rating and rankings after each of the mm months   for a particular player if there are multiple peak rating or peak ranking months chef was to consider the earliest of them  if multiple players had the same rating at the end of some month they were to be given the same rank  for example if there were  players and their ratings at the end of some month were     and  players   and  were to be given the first rank while players  and  should be given the fourth rank  as chef hates statistics he asks you his friend to help him find this  can you help chef input  the first line contains an integer tt the number of test cases  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm the number of players and the number of months that the tournament spanned over  the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers rr…rnrr…rn denoting the initial ratings of the players i e  their ratings before the start of the tournament  the next nn lines each contain mm spaceseparated integers  the jthjth integer of the ithith line cijcij denotes the rating change of the ithith player after the jthjth month   output for each test case print the number of players whose peak ratings did not occur in the same month as their peak ranking in a new line  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nm≤≤nm≤ ≤ri≤≤ri≤ −≤cij≤−≤cij≤  subtasks   points  ≤nm≤≤nm≤  points  original constraints                          sample input                                                                              sample output                              explanation test case   the ratings for player  after each month are   and  while his rankings are first third and third respectively  thus his best rating and best ranking occur after the same month i e  after the first month  the ratings for player  after each month are   and  while his rankings are first first and first respectively  his best rating occurs after the third month while his best ranking occurs after the first month we consider the first month even though his peak ranking is over all the months because we consider only the earliest month where he attains the peak ranking  the ratings for player  after each month are   and  while his rankings are third second and second respectively  his best rating occurs after the third month while his best ranking occurs after the second month   so there are two players  and  whose peak ratings did not occur in the same month as their peak ranking and hence the answer is   test case   the ratings for player  after each month are   and  while his rankings are second second and first respectively  best rating is after second month but best ranking is after third month  the ratings for player  after each month are   and  while his rankings are first first and second respectively  best rating is after second month but best ranking is after first month   so there are two players  and  whose peak ratings did not occur in the same month as their peak ranking and hence the answer is    author akashadm editorial  codechef comproblemselomax tags                                   sorting implementation                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
