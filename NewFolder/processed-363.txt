 read problem statements in bengali russian mandarin and vietnamese as well  the functional array of an array aaa…anaaa…an is the array fafa of size n−n− where faiai−aifaiai−ai for ≤in≤in  for example if aa then fafa  you are given two arrays bbb…bnbbb…bn and zzz…zmzzz…zm of length nn and mm respectively  find out whether there exists an array aa such that  bb is a subsequence of aa and fafa is a subsequence of zz  print yes without quotes if such an array aa exists and no otherwise  input format  the first line of input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  each test case contains three lines of input  the first line contains two integers nn and mm  the lengths of bb and zz respectively  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers bb…bnbb…bn the elements of bb  the third line contains mm spaceseparated integers zz…zmzz…zm the elements of zz   output format for each test case output a single line containing one word  either yes or no  you may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase for example the strings yes yes yes and yes will all be treated as identical  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤bi≤≤bi≤ ≤zi≤≤zi≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed  the sum of mm over all test cases does not exceed   subtasks subtask   points  ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤bi≤≤bi≤ ≤zi≤≤zi≤ the sum of mm over all test cases does not exceed   subtask   points  ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤bi≤≤bi≤ ≤zi≤≤zi≤ the sum of mm over all test cases does not exceed   subtask   points  original constraints                         sample input                                                                  sample output                            yes no explanation test case  aa is one possible array   bb is a subsequence of aa fafa is a subsequence of zz   test case  it can be shown that no array aa can both contain bb as a subsequence and also have fafa be a subsequence of zz  author ★inov editorial  codechef comproblemsfunarr tags                                    knapsack greedy                                                              algorithms dynamic programming knapsack                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
