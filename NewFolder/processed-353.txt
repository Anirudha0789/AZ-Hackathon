 read problem statements in mandarin chinese vietnamese and russian you are given an array aa with nn positive integers  an xxinsider of this array is a subsequence of aa such that xx is strictly in between any two consecutive elements of the subsequence   more formally a subsequence sss…sk−sss…sk− of the array aa is an xxinsider if for every integer ii such that ≤i≤k−≤i≤k− either  si−xsisi−xsi or si−xsisi−xsi  for example for the array  the subsequence  is a insider because  and   the subsequence  is not an xxinsider for any integer xx  the subsequence  is a insider as well as a insider   let mkmk be the smallest integer such that aa contains an mkmkinsider of length exactly kk  if such an integer does not exist then mk−mk−  similarly let mkmk be the largest integer such that aa contains an mkmkinsider of length exactly kk  if such an integer does not exist then mk−mk−  find mm…mnmm…mn and mm…mnmm…mn  input format  the first line contains an integer tt the number of testcases  the description of the tt testcases follows  each testcase consists of two lines  the first line contains a single integer nn the size of the array aa  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an the elements of the array aa   output format  for each testcase print two lines  in the first line print n−n− space separated integers the values of mm…mnmm…mn respectively  in the second line print n−n− space separated integers the values of mm…mnmm…mn respectively   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ sum of nn over all testcases ≤⋅≤⋅ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for all valid ii                         sample input                                                                    sample output                                            explanation test case  the given array is    insiders of length  the only subsequences of length  that are xxinsiders for integer values of xx are   the subsequences  are insiders  all of them are insiders  the subsequences  and  are insiders  thus mm and mm  insiders of length  the subsequences of length  that are xxinsiders for some integer xx are   and    is both a insider and a insider  is only a insider and  is both a insider and a insider  thus mm and mm  insiders of length  the subsequences of length  that are xxinsiders for some integer xx are  and    is both a insider and a insider  and  is a insider  thus mm and mm  insiders of length  the only subsequence of length  is the array aa itself which is not an xxinsider for any integer value of xx  thus mm−mm−  hence the answers for this testcase are m−m− and m−m−  test case  the given array is   since all elements are equal none of the subsequences of this array are xxinsiders for any integer xx  hence the answers are m−−m−− and m−−m−−  test case  the only subsequence of length at least  that is an xxinsider for integer values of xx is  which is a −−insider  hence the answers are m−m− and m−m−   author srikkanthadm editorial  codechef comproblemsinsider tags                                   difference arrays greedy sliding window sorting binary search                                                              data structures arrays algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
