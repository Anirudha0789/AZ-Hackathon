 tonmoy has a special torch  the torch has  levels numbered  to  and  states onon and offoff  levels  and  correspond to the onon state while level  corresponds to the offoff state   the levels of the torch can be changed as  level  changes to level   level  changes to level   level  changes to level   level  changes to level    given the initial state as kk and the number of changes made in the levels as nn find the final state of the torch  if the final state cannot be determined print ambiguousambiguous instead  input format  first line will contain tt the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  each test case contains of a single line of input two integers nknk  the number of changes made in the levels and initial state of the torch  here kk denotes offoff state while kk denotes onon state    output format for each test case output in a single line the final state of the torch i e  onon or offoff  if the final state cannot be determined print ambiguousambiguous instead  you may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase for example the strings onon onon onon and onon will all be treated as identical  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤                         sample input                                                            sample output                            off on ambiguous explanation test case  initially the torch is in offoff state  since only level  corresponds to the offoff state the torch is at level  initially  after  changes the final level would be   level  corresponds to the offoff state  hence finally the torch is offoff   test case  initially the torch is in onon state  after  changes the torch remains in the onon state  test case  initially the torch is in onon state  this can correspond to any of the first  levels  thus we cannot determine the final level after  changes  hence the final state is ambiguousambiguous   author ★rudro editorial  codechef comproblemsdarlig tags                                   case work                                                              special                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
