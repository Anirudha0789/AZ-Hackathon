 abhishek is working in one of the best telecommunication companies of the world  he joined this company recently  to test his skills his boss assigned him to help two of their customers aryan and ali   initially both of their phone numbers are empty fantasy world you see  during each day  one of the following things can take place  last digit of numbers of either aryan or ali can be erased  a new digit can be appended at the end of the numbers of either aryan or ali   the company also has a magical number mm of length nn where each digit is between  and  both inclusive  the positions of digits are numbered from  to nn from left to right  aryan and ali will be happy if both of their numbers appear as nonoverlapping subsequences of mm  more formally suppose that aryan chooses some positions from mm such that the digits at those positions form his current number in the same order let the positions be aaa   apaaa   ap   now  ali chooses some positions not already chosen by aryan such that the digits at those positions form his current number in the same order let the positions be bbb   bqbbb   bq  then the following conditions should hold true   aiai as well as bibi are strictly increasing sequences  for all pairs aibjaibj ≤i≤p≤i≤p ≤j≤q≤j≤q ai≠bjai≠bj  values of aiai  are pairwise distinct  ≤i≤p≤i≤p  values of bibi  are pairwise distinct  ≤i≤q≤i≤q  mamama    mapmamama    map forms aryans number  mbmbmb    mbqmbmbmb    mbq forms alis number   over a period of dd days abhishek has to follow one of the following instructions each day  appendappend xx yy  you have to append digit yy to the end of xxs number  eraseerase xx  erase the last digit from xxs number    abhishek has to help these customers over a period of dd days  as he is a new employee he asks for your help  for each of the dd days you have to tell whether the phone numbers of aryan and ali appear as nonoverlapping subsequences of mm  note  prefer using fast io methods as the input is large  input format  first line will contain two spaced integers nn  dd the next line will contain the magical number mm of length nn dd lines follow  each of these lines will contain either of the following appendappend xx yy  you have to append digit yy to the end of xxs number  eraseerase xx  erase the last digit from xxs number    output format  print dd lines  on the ithith line print yes without quotes if both aryan and ali will be happy after the ithith day otherwise print no without quotes  you can print any character of the answer in any case ie yes yes nono etc will be considered valid response    constraints  ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ ≤d≤⋅≤d≤⋅ the length of numbers of aryan and ali does not exceed   mm consists of digits from  to   xx is either aryan or ali  yy can be any digit from  to   during the erase operation the corresponding persons number is non empty  the numbers of aryan ali and even the magical number mm can contain leading zeroes                          sample input                               append aryan  append ali  append ali  append aryan                           sample output                            yes yes yes no explanation  at the end of first day aryans number is   while alis number is empty  since  can be obtained as a subsequence of mm aryan is happy  ali is also happyas his number is empty  at the end of second day numbers of aryan and ali are  and  respectively  aryan can choose the subsequence formed by the digit at position  while ali can choose the digit at position    since these are distinct positions  both will be happy  at the end of third day numbers of aryan and ali are  and  respectively  aryan can choose the same position as before while ali can choose positions  and   as these are distinct positions both will be happy  at the end of forth day numbers of aryan and ali are  and  respectively  since aryan cannot choose any subsequence  he will be unhappy ali still being happy                             sample input                               append aryan  append ali  append aryan  append aryan  append ali  append ali  append ali  append ali  erase ali erase ali                          sample output                            yes yes yes yes yes yes no no no yes  author ★needforcode editorial  codechef comproblemslckali tags                                   jump pointers dynamic programming greedy                                                              advanced algorithms pre processing algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
