 you are given two arraysa and b each of size nn  in one step you can choose any two index ll and rr such that ≤l≤r≤n≤l≤r≤n and increment bibi by  for l≤i≤rl≤i≤r  find the minimum number of steps required to make both are identical  input  first line will contain nn size of each array   second line contains nn space separated integers ithith number denotes the value of aiai   third line contains nn space separated integers ithith number denotes the value of bibi    output print the minimum number of steps required to make both arrays identical  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤bi≤ai≤≤bi≤ai≤  sample input             sample output   explanation we can select the following ranges   once  once and  four times   author ★murugappans editorial  codechef comproblemsiarray tags                                   ccpc easymedium greedy murugappans                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
