  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef taught his brother chefu about right angled triangle and its properties  chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles  chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is h and its area is s chefu is confused how to solve it  i hope you are not  please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse h and area s  if it not possible to do so then output   input the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of testcases  t test cases follow  for each test case there will be a single line containing two space separated integers h and s  output output the answer for each testcase in a single line  if it is not possible to find such a triangle output   otherwise print  real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in nondecreasing order  please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than   in absolute value from the correct lengths  constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ h ≤   ≤ s ≤                          sample input                                                              sample output                                           author ★kingofnumbers tester ★mgch editorial  codechef comproblemsrighttri tags                                   geometry                                                              mathematics                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
