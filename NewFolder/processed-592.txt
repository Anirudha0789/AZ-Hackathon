 nasa went for a space mission to conquer a planet filled with aliens we can only invade that planet if we break more than  alien building else humans loose there are aa alien stations numbered from  to  i e aiiaii  if pipi denotes power of ithith building then                                         pi⌈aimk⌉pi⌈aimk⌉                                                where ⌈n⌉⌈n⌉ denotes ceiling of number nn and  mkmk are integer constants  the human gun power is xx which means it can break alien buildings whose power are less than or equal to xx  find whether the humans win or loose and also find maximum number of houses humans can break  input  first line will contain tt denoting number of test cases  then the tt lines follow  first line of each test case will contain three integers mkmk and xx  output  print yesyes if human wins otherwise print nono without quotes in a single line and in next line print maximum no of houses human can break    constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤   ≤mkx≤≤mkx≤   example input      example output no    author ★coldnights editorial  codechef comproblemsalien tags                                   binarysearch coldnights easy enau encoding                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
