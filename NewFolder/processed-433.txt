 a scientist is performing an experiment  she has to note down the exact time at which n interesting events occur  unfortunately she is very tired and misses some digits while noting down the time  also she just forgets about the date   so at the end there are n timestamp entries in hhmmss format where hh denotes the hour mm minutes and ss the seconds  the time is in hour format  some of the digits are missing and will be denoted by a    the scientist has also forgotten how long back she had started the experiment so given these n times what is the minimum amount of time that has passed since the start of the experiment  the ith event always occurs after or at the same time as the ith event  the first event always begins at  and that timestamp is correctly noted  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of events  the next n lines each contain strings t t     tn denoting the n timestamps  each timestamp has  characters of the form hhmmss without quotes denoting the hour hh minute mm and seconds ss  each part maybe prefixed by a  to make it fit in the format  some of the digits in the timestamp may be absent and will be denoted by   output for each test case output a single line containing the minimum number of seconds taken for the experiment to be completed  constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤  sum of all n over all test cases in a single test file will not exceed   example input                    output      explanation example case   the first event and last event takes place exactly  hours apart and all the other event could have occurred between these  events  so the minimum amount of time passed is  hours or        seconds  example case   since we have to minimize the amount of time passed we can fill all  with  and assume the second event occurred at    author admin tags                                   acm admin greedy icpc implementation kgp                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp  submit
