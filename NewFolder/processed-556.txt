 there is a hallway of length n−n− and you have mm workers to clean the floor  each worker is responsible for segment liriliri i e  the segment starting at lili and ending at riri  the segments might overlap   every unit of length of the floor should be cleaned by at least one worker  a worker can clean  unit of length of the floor in  unit of time and can start from any position within their segment  a worker can also choose to move in any direction  however the flow of each worker should be continuous i e they can’t skip any portion and jump to the next one though they can change their direction  what’s the minimum amount of time required to clean the floor if the workers work simultaneously input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   each testcase contains of mm lines of input  first line contains  space separated integers nn mm length of the hallway and number of workers  each of the next mm lines contain  space separated integers lili riri endpoints of the segment under ithith worker   output for each testcase output in a single line minimum time required to clean the hallway or −− if its not possible to clean the entire floor  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤liri≤n≤liri≤n the sum of mm over all tests is atmost ∗∗                         sample input                                                                        sample output                               explanation case  the first worker cleans the segment  the second cleans  and the third cleans  each taking  units of time  so the minimum time required is  units  case  segment  is not covered by any worker and hence the entire hallway cant be cleaned  case  the first worker cleans the segment  taking  units of time and the second cleans  taking  units of time  so the minimum time required is maxmax units   author daanishadm editorial  codechef comproblemsdrive tags                                   priority queue multiset sorting binary search on answer                                                              data structures queues sets algorithms searching binary search                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
