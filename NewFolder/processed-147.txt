 akash has his maths test tomorrow  he secretly found out one of the questions from the test  as the test is online he wants to write a code that solves the question  however he is not good at coding and thus wants chef to help him with that  chef is given a function fxfx such that the condition  fxf⋅xfxf⋅x holds true for all xx where xx is a positive integer   for a given positive integer nn find the maximum number of distinct elements in the array fff…fnfff…fn  input format  first line will contain tt  the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  each test case contains a single line of input one integer nn   output format for each test case output in a single line the maximum number of distinct elements in the array fff…fnfff…fn  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  subtasks  subtask   points ≤n≤≤n≤ subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                        sample output                              explanation test case  let xx  thus ⋅⋅x⋅⋅x  therefore ffff  so in the array ffff there is only  distinct element  test case  here we can take xx  thus ffff  similarly if we take xx ffff  this means that ffffff  however it can be possible that the values ffff and ff are distinct  hence the maximum number of distinct elements in the array ffffffffff is    author ★justfun editorial  codechef comproblemschfdbt tags                                   cakewalk justfun march math                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
