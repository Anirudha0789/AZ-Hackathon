  read problems statements in mandarin chinese here  read problems statements in russian here problem statement chef has a sequence of n segments l r l r     ln rn  he wants to transform the first segment to the last one with index n  his plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations firstly he will transform the first segment to the second one then to the third one then to the fourth one and so on till nth one  chef can use operation of a single type shift one segment border by one unit  so if he has segment l r he can transform it into one of the following segments l   r we will denote such operation with string l l r   will be denoted as r l   r l l r   r  chef doesnt like empty segments therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty l  r  chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible  please help him  find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment  if there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows   the first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of segments chef has xa the following n lines contain pairs of integers  the ith line contains integers li ri denoting ith chefs segment  output for each test case print an answer  two lines  the first line should contain the minimal number of operations  the second line should contain the sequence of operations without any whitespaces  constraints  ≤ t n ≤    ≤ li  ri ≤   the total sum of n values for all test cases doesnt exceed                            sample input                                                                                sample output                             rlrlrlrlr    r  lrllllrrrrlrl  author ★gerald tester ★rustinpiece editorial  codechef comproblemsgerald tags                                   implementation                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
