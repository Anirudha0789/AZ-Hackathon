  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian   many of you know about a popular logic game called euclid the game  everything was fine but then the game came into the real world because of a horrible mistake of one of the players  now the whole world is in danger the world can be described as the cartesian plane where each point has two real coordinates x and y  in order to save the world you are to complete the following task  task suppose you are given an angle which measures exactly n degrees where n is an integer with xaxanxaxa  you are to answer the question is it possible to construct using only a straightedge and compass n rays which divide this angle into n equal angles of size  degree if the answer is yes you must demonstrate this by listing the steps you would take to generate these rays  instructions you will be given three points v r and r  the angle you are to consider is the clockwise angle from the ray vr to the ray vr  this angle in degrees will always be an integer n with   n    if the above construction is possible you are able to perform two types of operations  construct a line that connects two known points a and b  construct a circle with center at a known point c and radius equal to the distance between two known points a and b     a point p is called known if it satisfies one of these two statements  p is equal to one of v r or r  p is one of the points of intersection of any lines or circles constructed in previous steps     the construction is complete once you have found n known points d d     dn such that the rays vd vd     vdn divide the given angle into n equal angles of size  degree  input the first line of the input files contains two spaceseparated real numbers with precision at least e the x and y coordinates of v  the second and third lines contain the coordinates of r and r similarly  output the first line of the output should contain a single word yes or no  whether it is theoretically possible to perform the construction described above with a straightedge and compass only  if your answer is no do not output anything else  if your answer is yes the following lines should describe your operations one per line as follows  if you want to construct a line between known points a and b output the word line followed by  spaceseparated numbers  the coordinates of a followed by the coordinates of b  a and b must not be the same point  if you want to construct a circle with center at the known point c and radius equal to the distance between known points a and b output the word circle followed by  spaceseparated numbers  the coordinates of c followed by the coordinates of a and b  a and b must not be the same point but there are no such restrictions on c  once you have performed all necessary operations output a single line with the word answer  in each of the next n lines output two spaceseparated numbers  the coordinates of d d     dn listed in clockwise order  each of these must be known points  constraints the absolute value of any coordinate given in the input does not exceed   all input coordinates have a precision of at least e  prior to precision adjustments the clockwise angle formed by the input points in degrees is guaranteed to be an integer n with   n    all coordinates in the output are compared for equality with precision e  this means that you can use point h as a known point if there is a true known point k with hxkx and hyky no more than e each  your solution must not output more than  operations  subtasks  subtask    points n ≤  subtask   points maximum constraints     example input              output yes line         line         circle              line         line         circle              circle              line         answer       there are other acceptable solutions  the line breaks inside the second to last coordinates for each circle are for website display reasons only and should not exist in your output  explanation the measure of the given angle is  degrees  it is well known that we can bisect any angle with a compass and straightedge so we can certainly do so for a  degree angle  this divides the angle into two degree angles as required  the method presented is one way of doing so and looks like this   author ★pavel tester ★shiplu editorial  codechef comproblemsdividen tags                                   geometry adhoc binary search                                                              mathematics algorithms constructive searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
