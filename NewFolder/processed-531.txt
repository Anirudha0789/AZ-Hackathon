  there are n lights above a road along the xaxis  the ith light has xi as its xcoordinate and it is hung yi above the road  the ith light illuminates a triangular area which is an isosceles triangle and its bottom edge is on the xaxis  the half of the top angle of the triangle is zi degrees  see the below figure you have an aircraft which can fly on a fixed height  because of some unknown reasons this aircraft can fly only under the light  your task is to find the maximum possible height for your flight from xl to xr  the lights do not block the aircraft e g  the aircraft can safely fly through a light  input  the first line contains three parameters n l and r  the next n lines give the infomation about each light  the ith line contains three numbers xi yi and zi   output  output the maximum height you can reach  the value must have an absolute error less than or equal to     it is guarenteed that you can make the flight with the positive height   constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ l  r ≤   ≤ xi ≤    yi ≤   ≤ zi ≤ n is an integer but all other input values can be nonintegers                           sample input                                                                    sample output                               author jingboadm tester ★laycurse editorial  codechef comproblemslight tags                                   sweep line algorithm greedy binary search on answer                                                              advanced algorithms computational geometry algorithms searching binary search                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
