 the range of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum value in it  chef comes up with a crazy idea to minimize the range by changing atmost  elements in the array  he wants to check whether the minimum range he gets is right or not  please help him in verifying his answer  input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   first line of each test case contains an integer nn the no  of integers in the array  second line contains nn space separated integers aa   an−aa   an−    output for each testcase output in a single line the minimum range  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ −≤ai≤−≤ai≤  sample input          sample output   explanation chef changes the elements   and  to   and  resulting in the array        the minimum range is −−  there can be multiple ways to change atmost  elements to get the answer   author ★sahilbansal editorial  codechef comproblemschefampp tags                                   array easy mpcc sahilbansal sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
