  problem statement   given an array of  size  n  of integers with each element denoted as  arrayi      in this problem we are given a parameter  k  and we are supposed to find the  size of the largest contiguous subarray whose gcd is atleast k  if there is no subarray whose gcd is atleast k  print     constraints       n             arrayi    k       input format   the first line contains  integers n and k the size of the array and the parameter as described in the problem statement   the second line containts n space separated integers denoting the array    output format   print a single integer in a single line denoting the maximum contiguous subarray size whose gcd is atleast k    sample   input           output     explaination   gcd   is  and since its greater than  and there is no other subarray larger that this with gcd atleast   so the answer is    alternatively the subarray    is also having gcd  but since it also has a size  the answer remains  only    input            output     author skullcrackers editorial  codechef comproblemsgcdmax tags                                   binarysearch easymedium greatestcommondivisor ipca ipcquestion skullcrackers                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
