 chef has a sequence aa…anaa…an  for a positive integer mm sequence bb is defined as ba∗mba∗m that is appending aa exactly mm times  for example if aa and mm then ba∗mba∗m you have to help him to find out the minimum value of mm such that the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence is maximum possible  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum value of mm  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤∗≤n≤∗ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ its guaranteed that the total length of the sequence aa in one test file doesnt exceed ∗∗                         sample input                                                                  sample output                               explanation in the first test case choosing mm gives bb which has a longest strictly increasing sequence of length  which is the maximum possible  in the second test case choosing mm gives bb which has a longest strictly increasing sequence of length  which is the maximum possible   author ★rishupnitdgp editorial  codechef comproblemsrecndrot tags                                   constructive implementation                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
