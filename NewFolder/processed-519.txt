  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  watson gives to sherlock two strings s and s consisting of uppercase english alphabets  next he wants sherlock to build a flower in the following way he puts both strings perpendicular to each other in such a way that they overlap at the same character  for example if he has two strings abcdef and xxbczq one possible way to make a flower is  length of petals in the above flower are    and   a flowers ugliness is sum of absolute difference of adjacent petal lengths i e  i e  if adjacent petal lengths are l l l l then ugliness of flower is l  l  l  l  l  l  l  l   sherlock wants to find minimum value of ugliness if we consider all possible flower configurations  note that a configuration is valid even if any of the petal length is   input first line contains t number of test cases  each test case consists of string s in one line followed by string s in the next line  it is guaranteed that there exists at least one possible way to make a flower     output for each test case output in one line the required answer   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ lengths lengths ≤                          sample input                             abcde xxbczq bbb bbbbbb                          sample output                              explanation  test case  if we keep the configuration shown in statement the ugliness is  which is minimum possible  test case  one of the best configurations is         b  b b b  b  b b        b  where petal lengths are       author ★darkshadows tags                                   string arithmetic binary search                                                              data structures mathematics basic maths algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
