 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef is a network engineer at codechef  currently he has to design a network that connects nn computers numbered  through nn  the network should consist of these nn computers and exactly mm cables  usually a cable needs to connect two different computers but chef is okay with connecting computers to themselves too  therefore lets describe a cable by the pair of computers uvuv it connects where ≤u≤v≤n≤u≤v≤n  however for each valid pair of computers uvuv there must be at most one cable that directly connects this pair of computers  lets define the data consumption factor of a computer as the number of computers which are directly connected to it  in particular if a computer vv is directly connected to itself by a cable vvvv it is only counted as connected to itself once  the data consumption factor of the whole network is the maximum of data consumption factors of all computers  in the resulting network each computer needs to be connected directly or indirectly to all other computers so that they could communicate with each other  determine whether it is possible to design such a network  if it is possible find the minimum possible data consumption factor of the resulting network  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first and only line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum data consumption factor or −− if chef cannot design a required network  constraints  ≤t≤⋅≤t≤⋅ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤m≤≤m≤  subtasks subtask   points  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤m≤≤m≤  subtask   points ≤t≤≤t≤ subtask   points ≤t≤≤t≤ subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                            sample output                               explanation example case  the optimal configuration and the only configuration of computers is to connect computers  and  connect computer  to itself and computer  to itself  then the consumption factor of each computer is  because it is directly connected to itself and the other computer  example case  here the cables can connect pairs of computers   and   the consumption factor of each computer is   there is a configuration with consumption factor  where each computer is connected to itself but all the computers are not connected so this network configuration is invalid   author ★admin editorial  codechef comproblemschefk tags                                   graphs basic maths adhoc                                                              data structures mathematics algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
