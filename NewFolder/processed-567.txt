 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese  russian and vietnamese as well  chef and his wife chefina started playing a new game  at the beginning of the game chefina secretly writes down a matrix aa with nn rows numbered  through nn and nn columns numbered  through nn  all elements of this matrix are distinct positive integers  then chefina asks chef to find the position row and column of the element with value vv or determine that such an element does not occur in aa  chef does not know the matrix aa but he can ask chefina at most kk questions about it  each question must be in the format rcrc chefina answers chef with the number arcarc  since this task is really hard for chef chefina decided to give him additional help — she told chef that the matrix she writes down has a special property each row and each column is sorted in some order descending or ascending  different rows and columns may be sorted in different order  chef may ask at most kk questions in the format above  afterwards he must tell chefina the position of the element vv in the format ijij with the meaning that aijvaijv if vv occurs in aa or with ij−ij− if vv does not occur in aa  this is an interactive problem  you should play the game for chef the grader plays for chefina  input the first line of the input contains three spaceseparated integers nn kk and vv  interaction to ask a question print one line containing three spaceseparated integers  rr and cc to the output  then read the answer to this question from the input  the answer for an invalid question is −−  you may ask at most kk questions  dont forget to flush the output after printing each line finally print the answer as one line containing three spaceseparated integers  ii and jj  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤aij≤≤aij≤ for each valid ijij ≤v≤≤v≤  subtasks subtask   points  ≤n≤≤n≤ kn⋅nkn⋅n  subtask   points  ≤n≤≤n≤ kk  subtask   points  ≤n≤≤n≤ kk  subtask   points  ≤n≤≤n≤ kk  example input     interaction chef             chefina                                                                    explanation chefina wrote down a matrix with  columns and  rows  chef needs to find the number  in at most  questions  one possible matrix aa could be               author ★allllekssssa editorial  codechef comproblemsinmat tags                                   interactive problems binary search                                                              special algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
