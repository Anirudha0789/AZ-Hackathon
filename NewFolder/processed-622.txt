 you task is to find minimal natural number nn so that nn contains exactly qq zeroes on the trail in decimal notation  as you know n∗∗   ∗nn∗∗   ∗n  for example     contains one zero on the trail  input the only line contains one number qq ≤q≤≤q≤ representing the number of trailing zeros  output in the only line print no solution if there is no such number nn and nn otherwise  sample inputs          sample outputs   no solution      author squtest editorial  codechef comproblemshwd tags                                   binarysearch chw factorial medium squtest                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp  submit
