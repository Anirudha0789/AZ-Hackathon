 there are nn piles of coins where the iith pile has aiai coins  you need to collect the maximum number of coins from these piles but you must fulfill the following condition  lets say you pick xixi coins from the iith pile then  xxxxxx…  xxxxxx ≤xi≤ai≤xi≤ai  for example if nn and aa you can pick the coins as xx  becuase xxxx and xx find the maximum total number of coins you can pick  input  the first line of input contains a single integer nn denoting the number of piles  the second line of input contains nn spaceseparated integers aiai where the iith integer denoted the number of coins in iith pile   output print a single integer denoting the maximum total number of coins you can pick  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤  sample input       sample output   explanation let xx hence xxxxxxxx and total number of coins picked is   it can be checked that it is not possible to pick any greater number of coins   author ★uttamsinghk editorial  codechef comproblemscmed tags                                   array cmed easy logicmaths uttamsinghk                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp js  submit
