 xa fluffy the squirrel is having a workout to keep his body fit  he arrives at a country with n cities arranged in a circle  there is a unidirectional road connecting city i and city i   for all  ≤ i ≤ n   with length li kilometres and also there is a road connecting city n and city  with length ln kilometres  fluffy starts at city   every day he can run at most x kilometres  however staying in the middle of the road is dangerous so he cannot reach the next city in time hell just stay in his current city and wait for the next day    fluffy would like to travel a total of y kilometres to become fit  he wonders what is the minimum number of days needed for him to do that  can you help him xa input the first line contains an integer n the number of cities  the next line contains n spaceseperated integers li as described above  the next line contains two spaceseperated integers x and y the maximum distance fluffy can run per day and the total distance fluffy needs to run  output output a single integer d the minimum number of days needed for fluffy to travel the desired distance  if the task is impossible output  instead  constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ li x ≤   ≤ y ≤   subtasks  subtask   points  n ≤  subtask   points  li is equal for all  ≤ i ≤ n subtask   points  the answer is either  or at most equal to  subtask   points  original constraints  example input         output   input         output    xa explanation example case   on the first day fluffy travels      kilometres by going from town  to town   he cant go any further because he can walk at most  kilometres a day  the next day he travels to town  walking another      kilometres  on the third day he goes to town  travelling another      kilometres  at this point he travelled        kilometres still short of the target which is  kilometres  the next day he will walk  more kilometres and reach his target   example case   fluffy will walk to town  on the first day travelling  kilometres  however he will never reach his target which is  kilometres because the next road is  kilometres long and he can walk at most  kilometres a day  so he can never reach his goal and the answer is    author ★zscoder editorial  codechef comproblemsmco tags                                   binarysearch easymedium mco sparsetable zscoder                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java cpp pyth pyp  submit
