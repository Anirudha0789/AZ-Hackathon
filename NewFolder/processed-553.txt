 read problem statements in bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  there are two types of vaccines available covaxin and covishield  a black marketeer has xx coins and wants to buy as many vaccines as possible  due to the black marketing concerns government has enforced the following policy  ithith dose of covaxin costs ai−⋅bai−⋅b coins for every i≥i≥   ithith dose of covishield costs ci−⋅dci−⋅d coins for every i≥i≥   the values of the four parameters abcabc and dd however isnt constant and might vary from query to query  in general the value of these four parameters for ithith query will be aibiciaibici and didi respectively   let ansiansi be the maximum total quantity of vaccines the black marketeer can buy corresponding to the ithith query  for each query you have to find the value of ansiansi   you will be given integers abcdpqrstabcdpqrst and mm which will define the queries to be followed   for i≥i≥ and i≤i−i≤i−  aiaiansi⋅tmodmpaiaiansi⋅tmodmp bibiansi⋅tmodmqbibiansi⋅tmodmq  ciciansi⋅tmodmrciciansi⋅tmodmr  didiansi⋅tmodmsdidiansi⋅tmodms    note since the output is large prefer using fast inputoutput methods  input format  first line contains of input contains an integer ii denoting the number of queries  second line of input contains five integers xabcdxabcd  third line of input contains six integers pqrstmpqrstm   output format for each query output the maximum quantity of vaccines the black marketeer can buy  constraints  ≤i≤⋅≤i≤⋅ ≤xabcd≤≤xabcd≤ ≤pqrsm≤≤pqrsm≤ ≤t≤≤t≤  subtasks subtask   points   ≤i≤≤i≤ ≤x≤≤x≤ time limit  sec   subtask   points   ≤i≤≤i≤ ≤x≤≤x≤ ≤a≤≤a≤ ≤b≤≤b≤ ≤p≤≤p≤ ≤q≤≤q≤ time limit  sec   subtask   points   original constraints time limit  sec                          sample input                                                                 sample output                               explanation test case    for the first query abcdabcdabcdabcd  it is optimal to buy  doses of covaxin  and  doses of covishield   so the total money spent is  and now the black marketeer cannot buy any more doses  so the answer is   for the second query abcdabcd⋅mod⋅mod⋅mod⋅modabcdabcd⋅mod⋅mod⋅mod⋅mod   for the third and the last query abcdabcdabcdabcd    author utkarshadm editorial  codechef comproblemscovaxin tags                                   ap binary search                                                              mathematics sequences and progression algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit    secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
