  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  a rank list is a list of ranks of persons in a programming contest  note that some of the persons might be having same rank       and       are few examples of rank lists whereas        are not rank lists   also note that a rank list need not to be sorted e g     and     are valid rank lists  mathematically a rank list is an array of numbers when sorted will have the starting element as  and difference between any two consecutive elements less than or equal to    a rank list is said to be an ideal rank list if no two persons gets equal rank in it   you can convert any rank list into an ideal rank list by applying following operations  in a single operation you can change value of any one element of the rank list to any value   chandan now wonders about minimum number of operations needed to convert a rank list of size n with sum of its element equal to s in to an ideal rank list  please help chandan find this minimum number of operations needed to create an ideal rank list   note that you are guaranteed that values of n s will be given in such a way that there will exist a valid rank list  input first line of input will give an integer t denoting number of test cases  then for next t lines each line will contain two space separated integers n s   output for each test case print a single line containing a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ s ≤                          sample input                                                              sample output                                explanation example case   only possible rank list in this case is  as it is already an ideal rank list hence you need zero operations   example case   only possible rank list in this case is    as it is already an ideal rank list hence you need zero operations   example case   one of the possible rank list is    you can convert it into an ideal rank list by changing any  to  i e     hence you need one operations   example case   only possible rank list is    you can convert it into an ideal rank list by changing a  to  and another  to  i e     hence you need two operations    author ★chandubaba tester ★pushkarmishra editorial  codechef comproblemsranklist tags                                   greedy adhoc observation                                                              algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
