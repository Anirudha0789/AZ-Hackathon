 this problem is similar to the problem intreective  the only difference between them is the number of queries allowed — in this problem up to  queries can be made  in div   and div   this problem is worth  points and intreective is worth   in div   this problem is nonscorable  this is an interactive task  you are given a tree consisting of nn nodes numbered from  to nn  chef selected an arbitrary node and marked it  chef gave you a judge to play with using which you can ask queries about the given tree  in each query you give the judge a nonempty set ss of nodes  the judge returns  if there exists uu and vv not necessarily distinct such that uv∈suv∈s and the marked node lies on the shortest path from uu to vv or  otherwise  you have to find the marked node  for each test case you can use at most  queries  interaction  begin the interaction by reading a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of interaction for tt test cases follows  for each test case first read a single integer nn denoting the number of nodes in the tree  n−n− lines follow  the ithith of these lines contains two spaceseparated integers uiui and vivi denoting an edge between the nodes uiui and vivi  it is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree  now you may begin asking queries  to ask a query about a set ss of kk nodes vv…vkvv…vk ≤k≤n≤vi≤n≤k≤n≤vi≤n all vivi are distinct output  kk vv vv …… vkvk you will then receive an integer xx  xx is  if there exists uu and vvnot necessarily distinct such that  uv∈suv∈s and the marked node lies on the path from uu to vv or  otherwise  when you have found the marked nodesay vv print the answer in the following format  vv outputting the answer doesnt count towards the limit of  queries  if at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit the interaction is terminated and you will receive a wrong answer verdict  if you receive a judge error verdict that means your program actually has one of many possible errors an idleness limit exceeded error it is waiting for input that does not exist a runtime error you asked an invalid query or possibly some other error  dont forget to flush the output after printing each line  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ the input graph is a tree sum of nn does not exceed ⋅⋅ over all test cases at most  queries can be made   sample interaction grader                you                                                                                                                                             explanation  test case  after the stst query we know that node  hasnt been marked  so we are left with only one possibility — node   test case  chef marked the node    note the above queries are just to demonstrate the interaction  they may or may not be sufficient to deduce the final answer    author ★satyam editorial  codechef comproblemsintreective tags                                   binarysearch easymedium interactive satyam start trees                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
