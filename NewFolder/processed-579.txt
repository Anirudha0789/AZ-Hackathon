 given kk arrays of length nn where the elements are bounded in the range lrlr  the function value of an array is defined as the sum of all elements present in it  in one move you can change at most  element from all the arrays and the changed value must lie within the range lrlr   what is the minimum number of operations required to make the function value of all arrays equal input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains four spaceseparated integers kk nn ll rr  next kk lines contains an array of length nn   output for each test case print the minimum number of operations needed to make the function value of all arrays equal in a new line  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤n∗k≤≤n∗k≤ ≤l≤r≤≤l≤r≤  example input                   example output   explanation  change array  to  no change in array   change array  to  change array  to  sum of all arrays is equal    author ★adikrsingh editorial  codechef comproblemsoperate tags                                   greedy sorting binary search                                                              algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
