  chef recently graduated computer science in university so he was looking for a job  he applied for several job offers but he eventually settled for a software engineering job at sharechat  chef was very enthusiastic about his new job and the first mission assigned to him was to implement a message encoding feature to ensure the chat is private and secure  chef has a message which is a string s with length n containing only lowercase english letters  it should be encoded in two steps as follows  swap the first and second character of the string s then swap the rd and th character then the th and th character and so on  if the length of s is odd the last character should not be swapped with any other   replace each occurrence of the letter a in the message obtained after the first step by the letter z each occurrence of b by y each occurrence of c by x etc and each occurrence of z in the message obtained after the first step by a   the string produced in the second step is the encoded message  help chef and find this message  input the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer n   the second line contains the message string s   output  for each test case print a single line containing one string — the encoded message  constraints ≤t≤  ≤n≤  sn  s contains only lowercase english letters sample input      sharechat    chef  sample output shizxvzsg  sxuv  explanation example case  the original message is sharechat  in the first step we swap four pairs of letters note that the last letter is not swapped so it becomes hsraceaht  in the second step we replace the first letter h by s the second letter s by h and so on so the resulting encoded message is shizxvzsg   author ★manishareddy editorial  codechef comproblemscho tags                                   array manishareddy strings                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
