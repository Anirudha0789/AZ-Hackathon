 while doing his research in the institute of lovely graphs rashad came up with another problem called prime graph  prime graph is a simple graph undirected graph which does not contain any selfloops or multipleedges with nn nodes such that the degree of each node is prime  rashad wants to know what is the maximum number of edges a prime graph with nn nodes can contain  can you help rashad answer this question note the degree of a node in a simple graph is the number of edges that are incident on the node and a prime number is a natural number greater than  which has exactly two divisors   and the number itself  input format  the first line contains tt  the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains nn  the number of nodes in the graph    output format for each test case output the maximum number of edges a prime graph of nn nodes can contain  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤                         sample input                                                         sample output                               explanation  for nn and  we can construct a complete graph a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge   for nn we can construct a prime graph with at most  edges  one such graph is   author ★mamedov editorial  codechef comproblemsprimegraph tags                                   cookoff cook graphs mamedov                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
