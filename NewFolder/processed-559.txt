 rocky loves watching the stars of the night sky  he has a telescope with a range length ll whose stand is damaged in such a way that you can’t move the telescope up down left or right  it can point only to a fixed point in the sky  rocky likes to watch as many stars as possible  so he got an idea and made a slider for the base of the stand  but the slider was too slippery so you have to fix the telescope to view through it  given nn stars and their coordinates on the horizontal line of vision of the telescope can you help rocky find the position to fix the telescope such that he can watch maximum number of stars note range length ll of the telescope is defined as if you fix the telescope such that the left endpoint is at coordinate xx on the horizontal line of vision then rocky can see all stars in the range xx to xlxl inclusive of endpoints  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn ll  the second line contains nn space separated integers xx… xnxx… xn where xixi denotes the xxcoordinate of the ithith star  as you can see the yycoordinate is irrelevant as all are along the same line  output for each test case print a single line containing two space separated integers aa xx  where aa denotes the maximum stars possible to see when the telescope is fixed and xx denotes the xxcoordinate of the left part of the range of the telescope   if there are multiple answers with the same highest no  of stars print the highest xxcoordinate among them  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤l≤≤l≤ xi≤xi≤  sample input                  sample output       author ★kishen editorial  codechef comproblemsskyfall tags                                   binarysearch cnxh easy kishen twopointers                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
