 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given a sequence of distinct nonnegative integers aa…anaa…an  for every nonnegative integer xkxk lets define a function fxfx as the number of inversions in the sequence a⊕xa⊕x…an⊕xa⊕xa⊕x…an⊕x  an inversion in a sequence xx…xnxx…xn is a pair of indices ijij such that ijij and xixjxixj  consider the sorted sequence of pairs fxxfxx for all integers x∈k−x∈k− a pair fxxfxx is earlier than fxxfxx in this sequence if fxfxfxfx or if fxfxfxfx and xxxx  you should find the second element i e  the number xx of the ppth pair in this sequence  the sequence is indexed from   input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains three spaceseparated integers nn kk and pp  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the number xx generating the ppth pair in the sorted sequence  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ≤p≤k≤p≤k ≤aik≤aik for each valid ii the elements of aa are pairwise distinct the sum of nn for all test cases does not exceed   subtasks subtask   points  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  subtask   points  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ the sum of nn for all test cases does not exceed   subtask   points  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ the sum of nn for all test cases does not exceed   subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                  sample output                              explanation example case  the values of fxfx for all ≤x≤≤x≤ are as follows  xx ff number of inversions in  xx ff number of inversions in  xx ff number of inversions in  xx ff number of inversions in  xx ff number of inversions in  xx ff number of inversions in  xx ff number of inversions in  xx ff number of inversions in   the sorted sequence of pairs fxxfxx is   we should find the ppth pair which is  so the answer is    author ★isaf editorial  codechef comproblemsxorsort tags                                   bitwise operation recursion sorting meet in the middle binary search                                                              mathematics bit manipulation algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
