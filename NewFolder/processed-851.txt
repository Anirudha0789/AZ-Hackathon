 problem statement let us define median of a square matrix m of size n  n as the median of the median of all rows  given a matrix m find it’s median  input section the first line contains t denoting the number of test cases  first line of each test case consists an integer n denoting the size of the matrix  next n lines contains n space separated integers denoting the elements of the matrix  as the test files are upto  mb it is advised to use faster input output in c and java  time limit may be too strict for python users  you are advised to use pypy  output section for each test case print the median of the matrix which is the median of the median of all rows  input constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤  n is odd   ≤ aij ≤  where aij deontes the element of the matrix in ith row and jth column   subtasks  subtask   points   ≤ n ≤  subtask   points   ≤ n ≤  subtask   points  original constraints  sample input               sample output   for the first test case the medians of the rows are     so the overall median of matrix is    author ★likecs editorial  codechef comproblemsgeek tags                                   cakewalk likecs likecs sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
