 a pastry chef made n pieces of pastries numbered them  through n and arranged them in this order in a row  there are k possible types of flavours numbered  through k for each valid i the ith piece of pastry has a flavour ai  the chef wants to select a contiguous subsegment of the pieces of pastry such that there is at least one flavour which does not occur in that subsegment  find the maximum possible length of such a subsegment of cakes  input format  the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two integers n and k  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers aa…an   output format  for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum length of a valid subsegment   constraints ≤t≤  ≤n≤ ≤k≤ ≤ai≤k for each valid i the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed                           sample input                                                                     sample output                              explanation in the first test case since we have only  flavorsflavor  is occuring  times and  is occuring  times  the maximum subsegment of pastries is of flavor  which is   in the second case we have  pastries and  flavors but the third flavor is not in the list hence whole array is valid answer   author ★aniket editorial  codechef comproblemscrcflav tags                                   aniket array contiguous help subarray                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
