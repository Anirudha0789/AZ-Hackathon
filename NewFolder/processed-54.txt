  ants have developed advanced ways to find distribute and make their own food to such extent that it has been said that ants eat more meat than lions wolves and tigers combined argentine ant is one of the world’s worst invasive speciesspecies which are not native to a specific location but have tendency to spread to a degree to cause damage to the native  species of a region present in the norfolk island  it forms supercolonies and are aggressive competitors displacing most other ant species  it can alter ecosystem processes such as  pollination and seed dispersal of native plant species  the federal environment department is in its mission to wipe out the species from  norfolk island  so they are carrying out a survey in t sites within the island examinig the  food sources  they know that the ant species can survive in a site only if the food available is more than k units or else they will eventually die out from the site  for every site  they go around the region examining n food sources and finding ai the unit of food available from the ith source ≤ i ≤ n   determine for each site whether the ant species can survive or they die out from the specific site   input  the first line contains two spaceseparated integers t and k  then information of t sites of the island follow  for each t the first line contains n the number of food sources and the second line contains n spaceseparated integers ai  ≤ i  ≤ n  output for each t output success without quotes if the ant species die out or failure if the ant species survives   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ k ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ ai ≤  example input              example output failure failure success  example case in the region the total food available is  units  so the ants survive   author ★horsbug editorial  codechef comproblemsargts tags                                   array beginner encoding horsbug horsbug                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
