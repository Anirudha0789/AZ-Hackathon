  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  there are n students living in the dormitory of berland state university  each of them sometimes wants to use the kitchen so the head of the dormitory came up with a timetable for kitchens usage in order to avoid the conflicts  the first student starts to use the kitchen at the time  and should finish the cooking not later than at the time a  the second student starts to use the kitchen at the time a and should finish the cooking not later than at the time a  and so on  the nth student starts to use the kitchen at the time an and should finish the cooking not later than at the time an the holidays in berland are approaching so today each of these n students wants to cook some pancakes  the ith student needs bi units of time to cook  the students have understood that probably not all of them will be able to cook everything they want  how many students will be able to cook without violating the schedule input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of students  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an denoting the moments of time by when the corresponding student should finish cooking   the third line contains n spaceseparated integers b b     bn denoting the time required for each of the students to cook  output for each test case output a single line containing the number of students that will be able to finish the cooking  constraints should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have  format it like   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤    a   a       an    ≤ bi ≤   example input                 output    explanation example case   the first student has  unit of time  the moment   it will be enough for her to cook  the second student has  units of time but wants to cook for  units of time and wont fit in time  the third student has  units of time and will fit in time because needs to cook only for  units of time  example case   each of students has  units of time but only the second one will be able to fit in time   author sergeyadm tester ★kevinsogo editorial  codechef comproblemskttable tags                                   loops conditional statements                                                              basic programming concepts                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
