 as we all know that there is a chance of war between india and pakistan  suppose in the future war begins and army chief has to distribute packets of explosives and each packet has a different number of explosives and every soldier must allocate at least one packet  chief makes many groups  in each group there are different numbers of soldiers  chief has nn number of packets chief has to allocate packets in a group who have mm number of soldiers  there are many ways to do so  but in each way one of the soldiers will get the maximum number of explosives  out of all these ways chief want to find the particular way in which the maximum number of explosives allocated to a soldier is minimum of those in all other permutations or ways and chief want to find that minimum number  please help the chief to do so   note return −− if a valid assignment is not possible and allotment should be in contiguous order see the explanation for better understanding  input the first line contains tt denoting the number of test cases  then follows the description of t test cases each case begins with a single positive integer nn denoting the number of packets  the second line contains nn spaceseparated positive integers denoting the number of explosives in each packet  the third line contains another integer mm denoting the number of the soldier in each group   output for each test case output a single line containing the minimum number of explosives each soldier has to read for the corresponding test case   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ ≤m≤≤m≤  sample input              sample output    explaination allocation can be done in following ways       maximum explosives          maximum explosives           maximum explosives    therefore the minimum of these cases is  which is selected as the output    author ★thesuraj editorial  codechef comproblemsaypa tags                                   binarysearch codechef coss externalcontest mediumhard thesuraj                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs pypy nodejs ruby php go kotlin scala js rust r swift sql  submit
