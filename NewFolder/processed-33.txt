 you are given a string ss of length nn  you have to output all the subsequences of ss with length exactly equal to nn in increasing order each in a new line  a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements  for ex  abcabc is a subsequence of abdcabdc while acbacb is not  input  first line will contain nn the length of the string  second line will contain the string ss   output for the given string ss print all the subsequences of ss with length exactly equal to nn  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ss only contains lowercase english alphabets   sample input  hey  sample output hey   author ★vok editorial  codechef comproblemsstrls tags                                   algorithm array beginner bgnr cakewalk codechef collegechapter easy simple simpleeasy strings vok                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
