  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  suraj the chief prankster is back in action now and this time he has stolen the valentines day gift given by ashi the love of chef to the chef and ran away with it to byteland  byteland is a not a regular place like chefs town  the safest way from chefs town to byteland is through the path of tasty dishes  the path is named so because there are magical tasty dishes which appear to the traveler that no one can resist eating  also suraj has added a strong sleep potion to each of the dish on this path to stop anyone from following him  knowing the devilish nature of suraj ashi is concerned about the chef and has asked all of chefs town people to help  the distance from chefs town to byteland through the the path of tasty dishes is x units  they have the location where the magic dishes are and how many people are required to eat it completely  anyone who eats a dish would go to a long sleep and wont be able to continue  they have the information about the tribal clans that live along the the path of tasty dishes who can be of real help in this journey   the journey chef and his friends can be described as follows there is a total of b dishes on the path of tasty dishes  each dish is located at some distance from chefs town denoted by xi for the ith dish  xi   xi  to minimize the number of friends chef has to leave behind all of them have decided that exactly yi of them will eat the ith dish which is the required number of people needed to finish it completely  also there are a total of c tribal chef clans each with their own population and location on the path that chef and his friends will meet on their way to byteland  they know that for some clan say i they are located at a distance of pi  pi   pi from chefs town with a population of ri  and if a group of at least qi men approaches them they would be able to convince them to join their forces against suraj  given the information about all this help the chef to find out the minimum size of the group including him and his friends he should start with to reach byteland and get back ashis gift from suraj  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  each test case contains three lines which are as follows first line of each test case contains x the distance of byteland from chefs town  next line contains an integer b the number of dishes on the path of tasty dishes  then follows b pairs of space separated integers of the form xi yi where xi yi are as defined above for the ith dish  next line contains an integer c followed c space separated triplets of integers pi qi ri as defined above   output for each test case print the minimum size of the group  including chef that is needed to reach byteland  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ x ≤   ≤ b ≤   constraints on c  subproblem   points  c   subproblem   points  ≤ c ≤   ≤ xi  x xi  xi  ≤ pi  x pi  pi  ≤ yi ≤   ≤ qi ≤   ≤ ri ≤  all the positions of the tasty dishes and tribal clans are distinct                              sample input                                                                                    sample output                               explanation example case   in the first case there are no tribal clans and two dishes one which needs to be eaten by  chefs on their way and one to be eaten by  chef  hence we have to start with atleast  people in total to pass the path of tasty dishes  example case   similar as example case   example case   in this case if we start with  chefs  at point  we have more than or equal to  chefs hence the tribal clan of size  adds to the chefs party and now they have size of   at position  three of them would be left behind eating a dish leaving  of them to go ahead  at position  since the size is exactly  the tribal clan joins the chefs party making it of size   at position  all  of them will stop to eat the dish and none would go ahead  similarly if we start with  one of them would be able to pass position  and reach position  where it will also add one of the tribal clans to its party and reach byteland   author pnkjjindal tester ★xcwgf editorial  codechef comproblemsashigift tags                                   dynamic programming binary search                                                              algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
