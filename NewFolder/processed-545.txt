 you are given nn and there exists an array of nn items which only the chef knows  the ith item of the array will have a weight wiwi and a profit pipi value associated with it  you are allowed to ask the chef the value of dpijdpij for a given ijij where dpijdpij denotes the maximum amount of profit you can earn if you pick the best subset of items from the first ii items of the array such that the sum of the weights of the picked items doesnt exceed jj  your aim is to determine the weight and profit of each item i e recover the ww and pp array  you are allowed to query at most  times  interaction  the first line of the input contains a single integer nn denoting the number of items in the array  you need to print to the standard output for the operations you wish to perform  there are two types of operations in the first type you are asking the judge the value of dpijdpij  you need to print a single line with  ii jj where the judge will return a single value by printing the integer in the standard input  it will be the value of dpijdpij  in the second type you are telling the judge the answer  for each test case you should perform this operation exactly once at the end  this operation is not taken into account when counting the number of queries done you need to print  lines the first line starts with  denoting the type of query  the second line consists of nn integers denoting the ww weights array in the format ww ww ww …… wnwn  the third line consists of nn integers denoting the pp profits array in the format pp pp pp …… pnpn   note dont forget to flush the standard output after printing each line  it can be done using fflushstdout in cc system out flush in java and sys stdout flush in python  if you exceed  queries or if in the first type of query ii and jj dont satisfy the inequalities ≤i≤n≤i≤n and ≤j≤≤j≤ or the ww and pp in the second type of query dont satisfy the inequality ≤wi≤≤wi≤ and ≤pi≤≤pi≤ for all i∈ni∈n then your program will get the verdict wrong answer  also note that there is a hidden ww and pp array and the solution is going to be matched exactly against it i e there is a unique solution for each test case  constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ for each query of first type ≤i≤n≤i≤n and ≤j≤≤j≤ for the query of second type ≤wi≤≤wi≤ and ≤pi≤≤pi≤ for all i∈ni∈n   example judge                                          you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    explanation we get that ww and pp   author ★sidhant editorial  codechef comproblemsinvsack tags                                   interactive problems bottomup binary search                                                              special algorithms dynamic programming dp approach searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
