 park street in kolkata is famous for its mouth watering sweets  there are a total of n  shops in the market which are extended over a single street with shops following one another  the shops are enumerated from  to n from left to right  the market is unique in the sense that each shop sells only a single type of sweet  additionally no two shops sell the same type of sweet  for convenience the different types of sweets are numbered from  to n  though the famous market has been running smoothly for many years the city mayor decided to have it completely overhauled and aims to make this famous market great again  so he has issued a tender for the shops which you happened to grab by using your good offices with the mayor  the tender specifies that you should decide which type of sweet each shop should sell  you would like to do so while keeping in mind that buyers like purchasing sweets if adjacent shops sell sweets of similar types because then they can purchase similar type sweets without wandering around many shops  formally you would like to minimize the maximum absolute value of difference between the types of sweets in adjacent shops  two shops which are numbered i and i   i  n are said to be adjacent to each other  the city mayor himself is very fond of sweets and has decided to have his own shop in the market too  he has chosen shop numbered s in which he will sell sweets of type q  for the remaining n   shops you have to assign which sweets should be sold so as to minimize the maximum absolute difference in the type of sweets in adjacent shops  input first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the only line of each test case contains three space separated integers n s q denoting number of shops in the market the shop chosen by the mayor and the type of sweet the mayors shop sells respectively  output for each test case output two lines  in the first line of each test case output the minimum value of the maximum difference in the types of sweets of adjacent shops  in the next line output n space separated integers denoting the types of sweets sold in each of the shops  if there are multiple answers output any one  constraints   ≤ t n ≤   ≤ s q ≤ n  example input         output         explanation example case  the city mayor has decided to sell sweets of type  in the second shop  in the first shop you can decide to sell sweets of type  and that of type  in the third shop  in this case maximum difference in the type of sweets of adjacent shops is   there can be one other way of assigning sweets with shops i e  sell sweets of type  in shop  and that of type  in shop   in this case also maximum difference in type of adjacent shops is   so you can see that in any case minimum value of maximum difference in type of adjacent shops will be   hence answer is    author admin tags                                   admin array constructive icpc kgp looping                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp  submit
