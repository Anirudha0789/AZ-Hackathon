  read problems statements in mandarin chinese and russian  sereja had an nonnegative integer a in the range    one day he wrote n pairs of the form xi  floora  xi  on a piece of paper  let us denote floora  xi by di  serejas little brother sergey is very naughty he changed the d values for some of the pairs  when confronted for his mischief by sereja he said that he did not touch more than k such pairs   now given the modified values of n pairs of the form xi di sereja is wondering about number of possible original values of integer a  please help sereja so that little sergey could avoid the upcoming beating by sereja  as the answer could be large please report it modulo     input first line of input contain an integer t — the number of test cases t test cases follow  first line of each test case contains integers n and k  each of the next n lines contains a pair that sereja wrote on the paper — xi and di — as two spaceseparated integers   output for each test case output a single line containing the answer  number of possible numbers a modulo    constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ k ≤ n ≤   ≤ xi  ≤   ≤ di  ≤                          sample input                                                                      sample output                               author serejaadm tester ★iscsi editorial  codechef comproblemsseapair tags                                   mathematics greedy sorting implementation                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
