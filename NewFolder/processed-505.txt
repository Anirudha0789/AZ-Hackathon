 chef gets confused between mean and median very often and as a result he has developed a dislike of arrays whose mean and median are not equal  chef has an array aa of nn elements  he can perform the following operation on it  pick an index ≤i≤n≤i≤n and increase aiai by    he would like to obtain an array whose mean and median are equal  determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this  note the median of an array aa of length nn is defined as follows sort the array aa  then   if nn is even the median is the nthnth element if nn is odd the median is the nthnth element  for example the median of the array  is  and the median of the array  is   input format  the first line of input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of testcases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn denoting the size of the array  the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an   output format for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations chef needs to perform to make the mean and median equal  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅                         sample input                                                                     sample output                               explanation test case  the mean and median of the array are both   they are already equal so no operations are required  test case  it is optimal to apply the operation on stst and ndnd index twice each  the array after applying these operations will be  which has both mean and median    author utkarshadm tester ★lavish editorial  codechef comproblemsmeanidian tags                                   d arrays basic maths sorting binary search                                                              data structures arrays mathematics algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
