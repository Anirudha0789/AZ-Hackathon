 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russianand vietnamese as well  in snakeland there are some snakes and mongooses  they are lined up in a row  the information about how exactly they are lined up it is provided to you by a string of length n  if the ith character of this string is s then it means that there is a snake at the ith position whereas the character m denotes a mongoose  you might have heard about the ageold rivalry between hares and tortoises but in snakeland the rivalry between snakes and mongooses is much more famous  the snakes and the mongooses want to hold a final poll in which the ultimate winner of this ageold battle will be decided  if the snakes get more votes than the mongooses they will be the ultimate winners  similarly if the mongooses get more votes than snakes they will be the ultimate winners  obviously each animal is loyal to their species i e  each snake will vote for the snakes to be the ultimate champions and each mongoose for the mongooses  tomorrows the election day  before the elections the mongooses decided to cheat  they planned that each mongoose will eat at most one of its neighbor snakes  two animals are said to be neighbors of each other if they are consecutive to each other in the row  after this the elections will be held  the mongooses planned in such a way that the number of snakes eaten is maximized  can you find out who will win the final poll output snakes mongooses or tie correspondingly   input first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follow  the only line of each test case contains a string consisting of characters s and m   output for each test case output a single line containing snakes mongooses or tie correspondingly without quotes  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ s ≤   example input  sm ssm sms ssmmmssss  output mongooses tie tie snakes  explanation example   the mongoose will eat the snake  only the mongoose will be left  so on the election day there is one mongoose and zero snakes  so mongooses will win  example   the mongoose will eat the snake at position  based indexing  one mongoose and one snake will be left  hence there will be a tie  example   the mongoose can eat either the snake to its left or to the right  but it can eat only one of them  afterwards there will be a single snake and mongoose  so it will result in a tie   example   the mongooses can eat at max two snakes  for example smmmsss where  denotes the snakes that were eaten by mongooses  after this we have four snakes and three mongooses  so the snakes win   author admin tester ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemssnelect tags                                   conditional statements greedy adhoc implementation                                                              basic programming concepts algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
