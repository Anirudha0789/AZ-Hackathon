 the chef is owning a team and participating in an upcoming tournament  there are nn teams in the tournament apart from chef’s team and chef’s team plays against each of these nn teams exactly once  the point system in the tournament is weird  if a team wins a match it will receive kk points where kk is the number of matches the team has played till then including the current one  each teamiteami has a power value pipi  and the power of the chef’s team is mm  a team with greater power value will always beat a team with smaller power values  since chef is creating the schedule for the tournament  he wants to make his team get the maximum points possible  find the maximum points that the chefs team gets mod   input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   the first line of each testcase contains nn and mm the number of teams and power value of the chef’s team  the second line of each testcase contains nn space separated integers namely pp…pnpp…pn   output for each testcase output in a single integer the maximum points chef’s team can get  constraints   ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤pi≤≤pi≤ each element in p is pairwise distinct and not equal to mm  sample input        sample output   explanation chef’s team can play in the same order as input and receive  points by beating two teams in second match and third match respectively   author ★hareesh editorial  codechef comproblemsaoc tags                                   aoc greedy hareesh                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
