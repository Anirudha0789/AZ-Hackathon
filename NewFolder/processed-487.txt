 xa  flippy the bird has proposed n problems for the mco qualifiers  he has labelled the problems from  to n  fluffy the squirrel has reviewed the problems and assigned a difficulty rating di for each problem  the contest problems must have consecutive problem numbers  this means that the contest problems must have labels x x       y for two positive  integers x and y  he believes a contest is balanced if there are at least l problems and at most r problems  additionally the average difficulty rating of the problems must be at most a  flippy wants to set a to some real number which means it might have decimal places so that fluffy can choose the problems for the contest in at least k ways where k is a positive integer  flippy wants a to be as small as possible  find the optimal value of a   xa input  the first line contains  positive integers n l r k the number of problems minimum and maximum number of problems in a balanced contest and the minimum number of ways that fluffy can select the problems for the contest  the next line contains n spaceseperated integers denoting the difficulty level of the problems    xa output output a single real number a as explained in the problem statement  the answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed    xa constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ di ≤    ≤ l ≤  r ≤ n k will not exceed the number of ways to choose the problems when a    subtasks  subtask   points   ≤ n ≤  subtask   points   ≤ n ≤  subtask   points  l   r  n subtask   points  original constraints  xa example input           output    xa explanation example case  indeed there are  ways to choose the problems so that the average is at most    or more precisely  but the error is less than   so this is accepted the  choices are              author ★zscoder editorial  codechef comproblemsmco tags                                   binarysearch binarysearchtree dynamicprogramming zscoder                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java cpp pyth pyp  submit
