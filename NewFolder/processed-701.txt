 there is a tree with nn nodes numbered from  to  nn outside harshikaas house  the tree is rooted at node   initially the tree was dry there were no raindrops on any node of the tree  suddenly it started raining and every second a drop falls on all the leaf nodes of the tree  also every second any drop which wasnt already on the root node moves one node closer to the root  sometimes strong winds shake the tree and all drops which were not on the root fall off  it is known that the wind will shake the tree mm times at aa…amaa…am seconds after it started raining   if multiple events happen at the same second they are in this order  raindrops move one node closer to the root  new raindrops fall on the leaves  wind shakes the tree   how many drops are there at the root right after the mmth shake input format  the first line of each input contains tt  the number of test cases  the test cases then follow  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm  the number of nodes on the tree and the number of shake events  n−n− lines follow each line containing two spaceseparated integers uu and vv denoting an edge between node uu and vv on the tree  the next line contains mm spaceseparated integers aa…amaa…am  the timestamp of the shakes   output format for each test case output in a single line the number of raindrops on the root right after the mmth shake  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n u≠vu≠v ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ aa is strictly increasing sum of nn over all test cases is not more than ⋅⋅ sum of mm over all test cases is not more than ⋅⋅                         sample input                                                                  sample output                             explanation  test case  lets define an array rr where riri is the number of raindrops on the iith node   at second  rr  at second  a raindrop fell on all leaves  rr becomes   at second   firstly raindrops moved closer to the root so rr becomes   secondly a raindrop fell on all leaves so rr becomes   thirdly the tree was shook so every raindrop except the one on root fell  at the end of second  rr  at second  new raindrops fell and rr becomes   at second  rr becomes   at second   firstly raindrops moved closer to the root so rr becomes   secondly a raindrop fell on all leaves so rr becomes   thirdly the tree was shook so every raindrop except the one on root fell  at the end of second  rr   therefore at the end there were  drops at the root   author ★visheshs editorial  codechef comproblemsraindrops tags                                   depthfirstsearch depthfirstsearch depthfirstsearch easy easy easy exun exun exun graphs graphs graphs visheshs                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
