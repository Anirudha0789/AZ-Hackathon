  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  russian and vietnamese as well  sergey has made n measurements  now he wants to know the average value of the measurements made  in order to make the average value a better representative of the measurements before calculating the average he wants first to remove the highest k and the lowest k measurements  after that he will calculate the average value among the remaining n  k measurements  could you help sergey to find the average value he will get after these manipulations input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers n and k denoting the number of measurements and the number of the greatest and the lowest values that will be removed  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an denoting the measurements   output for each test case output a single line containing the average value after removing k lowest and k greatest measurements  your answer will be considered correct in case it has absolute or relative error not exceeding   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ k  n  ≤ ai ≤   subtasks  subtask   points k   subtask   points no additional constraints                         sample input                                                                         sample output                                  explanation example case   after removing  greatest and  lowest measurement we get the set     the average value in this set is   example case   the average value in the set      is    example case   after removing the  largest and smallest measurements sergey will be left with only one measurement i e    average of this is  itself   author sergeyadm tester ★zedthirtyeight editorial  codechef comproblemssimpstat tags                                   basic maths sorting                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
