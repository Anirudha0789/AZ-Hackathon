  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well   you are given an undirected compete graph with n nodes  each edge can be one of nn  different colors  these colors are labeled from  to nn inclusive  but not all these nn  colors need to be used  ie  it is possible that two different edges could have the same color  formally let cij denote the color between the ith and jth nodes  note that these edges are undirected so cij  cji  we will define cii to be zero although there is no such  edge present  i e  the graph does not contain selfloops  a subset of nodes is called interesting if every node in the subset has at least two edges of different colors connecting it to vertices in the subset  your task is to determine the maximum possible size of an interesting subset of nodes  note that by definition the empty subset of nodes is an interesting subset and so the answer is always at least zero   input  the first line of input will contain an integer t the number of test cases  each test case will be formatted as follows  the first line will contain a single integer n  the next n lines will contain n integers each  the jth integer on the ith line will denote cij   output  for each test case output the maximum possible size of an interesting subset in a new line   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ cij ≤ nn  if i  j then cij   cij  cji                         sample input                                                                                                                    sample output                                explanation  in the first case the set of all nodes is an interesting subset  in the second and third cases no nonempty subset of nodes is interesting  in the last case an interesting subset of nodes is   there is no larger interesting subset    author ★lg tester ★errichto editorial  codechef comproblemsrainbow tags                                   graphs greedy                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
