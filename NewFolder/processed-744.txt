 pushpa has entered chefland and wants to establish pushparaj here too   chefland has nn towers where the height of the ithith tower is hihi  to establish pushparaj pushpa does the following  initially pushpa chooses any tower ii ≤i≤n≤i≤n and lands on the roof of that tower  let xx denote the height of the tower pushpa is currently on then pushpa can land on the roof of any tower jj ≤j≤n≤j≤n such that the height of the jthjth tower is xx    let ii denote the index of the tower on which pushpa lands then the height of all towers except tower ii increases by  after each jump including the initial jump  to establish pushparaj pushpa wants to land at the maximum height possible  determine the maximum height pushpa can reach  input format  the first line contains a single integer tt  the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains an integer nn  the number of towers the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers hh…hnhh…hn denoting the initial heights of each of the towers from the ground   output format for each test case output in a single line the maximum height achieved by pushpa  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤hi≤≤hi≤                         sample input                                                             sample output                              explanation  test case  if pushpa chooses to start from tower at index  with height of  unit then the new heights will be   he can then jump to the rdrd tower with height  units  the updated heights of the towers is   pushpa is unable to make any more jumps    the optimal way to in this case is to take an initial jump at tower  with height   the maximum height pushpa can reach is    test case  there is only  tower so pushpa reaches the maximum height of  units    author ★ashishhanny editorial  codechef comproblemspushpa tags                                   sorting two pointers                                                              algorithms simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
