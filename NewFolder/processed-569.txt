  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  chef has a tree with n nodes numbered from  to n where each edge has some length  the chef length of a path is the median of the lengths of all edges along the path  more formally if we put lengths of all edges from the path into an array and sort it then the chef length of this path is the median of this array element in the middle of the sorted array and if we have two elements in the middle of the array then the median is the bigger one  for example if the array equals    then its median is  and if the array equals     then the median is   now chef wants to find minimum chef length among simple paths having at least l and at most r edges  please help him accomplish this task  input  the first line of input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  description of t test cases follows  the first line for a test case contains three spaceseparated integers  n l r  denoting the number of nodes in a tree and the limits on number of edges in any chosen path  each of next n −  lines contains three spaceseparated integers  a b and c  describing an edge in the tree  this edge connects vertex a with vertex b and has length c   output for each test case output a single line containing the shortest chef length amongst paths satisfying the given conditions  if there are no paths with at least l and at most r edges output   constraints   ≤ t ≤ ×  ≤ n ≤   ≤ l ≤ r ≤   ≤ a b ≤ n  ≤ c ≤  the sum of n over all the test cases in one file is at most × the given graph denotes a tree  subtasks subtask   points  the sum of n over all the test cases in one file is at most  time limit is  second  subtask   points  original constraints time limit is  seconds                         sample input                                                                                       sample output                              explanation test  lets look at all correct simple paths    lengths     chef length    lengths     chef length    lengths     chef length    lengths     chef length    lengths      chef length    lengths     chef length    lengths      chef length    lengths      chef length    and the reverse of these paths  so the smallest value we get is  and it is the answer  test  all correct paths   lengths      chef length    lengths      chef length    lengths       chef length    the shortest chef length is   note a simple path in a graph is a path which does not have any repeated vertices   author ★antoniuk tester ★laycurse editorial  codechef comproblemsstetsklx tags                                   deque trees centroid decomposition dynamic programming sliding window dfs binary search                                                              data structures queues graphs advanced algorithms advanced graph algos algorithms greedy graph algos traversals searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit    secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
