 read problem statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  codechef challenges have three divisions  in one challenge there are nn problems in each division but some problems may be shared among multiple divisions  each problem is uniquely identified by a code — a string containing only uppercase english letters  each participant can only submit in one of the divisions  chef wants to find the number of correct solutions in total among all  divisions for each problem  given a list of nn problem codes with the numbers of correct solutions for each problem in each division find the total number of correct solutions for each problem and sort them in nondecreasing order  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  nn lines follow  for each valid ii the iith of these lines contains a string sisi followed by a space and an integer cici — the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the iith problem in the third division  nn more lines follow  for each valid ii the iith of these lines contains a string sisi followed by a space and an integer cici — the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the iith problem in the second division  finally nn more lines follow  for each valid ii the iith of these lines contains a string sisi followed by a space and an integer cici — the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the iith problem in the first division   output for each test case let pp be the number of distinct problems you should print pp spaceseparated integers — the number of solutions for each of these problems sorted in nondecreasing order  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ ≤sisisi≤≤sisisi≤ for each valid ii sisisisisisi contain only uppercase english letters for each valid ii ≤cicici≤⋅≤cicici≤⋅ for each valid ii the problem codes in each division are pairwise distinct but some problem codes may appear in multiple divisions the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed                          sample input                              a  b  c   aa  ab  ab  ac  ac  ad   z  z  z                           sample output                                    explanation example case  there is only  problem in each division and no problems are shared among divisions so the total number of distinct problems is  and the numbers of solutions are  for a  for b  for c  example case  there are  problems in each division and each pair of consecutive divisions shares  problem so the total number of distinct problems is  and the numbers of solutions are  for aa  for ab  for ac  for ad  we need to sort them in nondecreasing order so the final answer is   example case  there is only  problem z in the entire contest shared among all divisions and the number of solutions for it is    author daanishadm tester ★iscsi editorial  codechef comproblemstotcrt tags                                   maps implementation                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
