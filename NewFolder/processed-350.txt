 gru has a string ss of length nn consisting of only characters aa and bb for banana and pp points to spend  now gru wants to replace andor rearrange characters of this given string to get the lexicographically smallest string possible  for this he can perform the following two operations any number of times   swap any two characters in the string  this operation costs  pointpoint  any two need not be adjacent  replace a character in the string with any other lower case english letter  this operation costs  pointspoints  help gru in obtaining the lexicographically smallest string possible by using at most pp points  input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   each testcase contains two lines of input firstline containing two integers nn  pp  the second line contains a string ss consisting of nn characters   output for each testcase output in a single containing the lexicographically smallest string obtained  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤p≤n≤p≤n ss only consists of ′a′′a′ and ′b′′b′  sample input    bba  sample output aab  explanation we swap ss and ss to get abbabb  with the  remaining points we replace ss to obtain aabaab which is the lexicographically smallest string possible for this case   author ★kabeer editorial  codechef comproblemsbanstr tags                                   string greedy binary search prefix sum                                                              data structures algorithms searching simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
