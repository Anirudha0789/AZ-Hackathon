 bhallaladeva was an evil king who ruled the kingdom of maahishmati  he wanted to erect a ft golden statue of himself and he looted gold from several places for this  he even looted his own people by using the following unfair strategy there are n houses in maahishmati and the ith house has ai gold plates  each gold plate costs exactly  nimbda which is the unit of currency in the kingdom of maahishmati  bhallaladeva would choose an integer k and loots all the houses in several steps  in each step  he would choose a house i which hasnt been looted yet pay the owner exactly ai nimbdas and take away all the gold plates in that house hence he also ends up looting this house  he would now choose atmost k houses which havent been looted yet and take away all the gold plates from these houses without paying a single nimbda yes he takes all of them for free   he repeats the above steps until all the n houses have been looted  your task is to devise a strategy for bhallaladeva to loot the houses in some order so that the number of nimbdas he has to pay is minimium  youll also be given multiple values of k q of them to be precise and you need to find the minimum number of nimbdas for each of these values  input the first line of input consists of a single integer n denoting the number of houses in maahishmati  the second line of input consists of n space separated integers denoting a a     an where ai denotes the number of gold plates in the ith house  the third line of input consists of a single integer q denoting the number of values of k to follow  each of the following q lines consist of a single integer where the value on the ith line denotes the value of k for the ith query   output output exactly q integers on separate lines where the output on the ith line denotes the answer for the ith value of k  constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ q ≤   ≤ k ≤ n  ≤ ai ≤   example input          output    explanation for the first query k    hence bhallaladeva cannot take gold plates from any of the houses for free  it will cost him          nimbdas  for the second query k    in the first step bhallaladeva can pay  nimbdas for gold plates in house number  and take the gold in houses  and  for free note that house  has  gold plates and house  has  gold plates  now he has looted houses      now in the second step he loots house  by paying  nimbda  hence the total cost        note that there might be multiple ways to achieve the minimum cost and we have explained only one of them   author ★suhash editorial  codechef comproblemsamrd tags                                   basic maths greedy prefix sum                                                              mathematics algorithms simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
