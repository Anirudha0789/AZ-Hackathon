 chef has an array aa of length nn  he defines the alternating sum of the array as  sa−aa−a…−n−⋅ansa−aa−a…−n−⋅an  chef is allowed to perform the following operation on the array at most once  choose two indices ii and jj ≤ij≤n≤ij≤n and swap the elements aiai and ajaj   find the maximum alternating sum chef can achieve by performing the operation at most once  note xx denotes the absolute value of xx  for example −− and   input format  the first line will contain tt  the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  size of the array aa  second line of each test case contains nn space separated integers  denoting the elements of array aa   output format for each testcase output in a single line the maximum alternating sum chef can obtain by performing the operation at most once  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ −≤ai≤−≤ai≤ sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅                          sample input                                                                 sample output                              explanation test case  one optimal way is to perform no operations  thus the alternating sum is −−−−−−  test case  one optimal way is to choose ii and jj  after swapping the array is −−−−−−  the alternating sum in this case is −−−−−−−−−−−−    author ★sg editorial  codechef comproblemspma tags                                   array implementation observation sg simple start                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
