 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef likes to mix colors a lot  recently she was gifted n colors a a     an by her friend  chef wants to make the values of all her colors pairwise distinct as they will then look stunningly beautiful  in order to achieve that she can perform the following mixing operation zero or more times  choose any two colors  lets denote their values by x and y  mix the color with value x into the color with value y  after the mixing the value of the first color remains x but the value of the second color changes to x  y  find the minimum number of mixing operations chef needs to perform to make her colors beautiful  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of colors  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an denoting chefs initial colors   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of required mixing operations  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ ai ≤  for each valid i  subtasks subtask   points  ≤ n ≤  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                              sample output                              explanation example case  no two colors have the same value  hence they are already beautiful  no mixing is required  example case  take the second color with value x   and mix it into the first color with value x    after the mixing the colors will be     now the colors are beautiful  this is the minimum number of mixing operations that are required  hence the answer is    author ★shivangigupta editorial  codechef comproblemsmixcolor tags                                   sets adhoc sorting                                                              data structures algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
