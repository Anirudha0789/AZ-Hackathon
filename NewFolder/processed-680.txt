 you are given a tree  if we select  distinct nodes uniformly at random whats the probability that the distance between these  nodes is a prime number input format the first line contains a number n the number of nodes in this tree  the following n lines contain pairs ai and bi which means there is an edge with length  between ai and bi  output format output a real number denote the probability we want  youll get accept if the difference between your answer and standard answer is no more than   constraints  ≤ n ≤   the input must be a tree                           sample input                                                              sample output                              explanation we have c    choices and these  of them have a prime distance        note that  is not a prime number   author chenadm tester ★whiteking editorial  codechef comproblemsprimedst tags                                   trees fft                                                              data structures graphs mathematics transformations                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
