 the kingdom of bytelandia has n cities numbered from  to n−  there are m bidirectional roads each of which connects two different cities  the road network in the kingdom is such that people of any city can reach any other city they desired through the road network  this is called having unity in the kingdom  bytelandia is very famous for its unity  the people are united and familiar with each other  the king of bytelandia is also very proud of this fact  but some people just want to watch the world burn  dr  bobo is one of such people  he is very wicked  he doesnt like unity of bytelandia  he has a chemical missile to spread diseases  he plans to attack one of the cities of bytelandia  the kings secret intelligence service became aware of dr  bobos wicked plan and informed the king about it  the king could not catch dr  bobo hence he is a genius  so the king planned the rescue mission with his own defense system  the scientists of bytelandia have made one kind of shields which can protect an entire city from the attack of dr  bobos missile  the shield will not affect the road network in the sense that a citizen can still travel on the roads connected to a protected city  but the shields are very very expensive to build  the king also has a team of brilliant doctors who have already discovered the cure for the disease which the missile will spread  but they can only handle one city at a time  the king has planned his rescue mission as follows if a shielded city is attacked by the missile then no one is harmed  if a city without a shield is attacked all the roads connected to that city will be closed to prevent the disease from spreading to the other cities  then the doctors will begin to cure each citizen of that city and as a precautionary measure none of those citizens are allowed to leave the city until each and every of them is cured  it will take a very long time to cure an entire city  taking a long time to cure an attacked city will affect the road network of the kingdom  the roads which are closed due to the attack can not be used until the affected city is entirely cured  this would have an adverse affect on the kingdoms unity which the king would never want especially at the time of crisis because in that case dr  bobo would have achieved his evil goal of dividing the people  the king can make as many shields as he wants but as we know they are very expensive  so he would let a city be attacked and then be cured by his doctors rather than pay to plant a shield over a city as long as it will not affect the unity of the remaining kingdom  that is city x must be protected by the shield if there exists a pair of cities except city x such that people cannot come and go between these cities when the roads connected city x are closed  he doesnt want to make unnecessary shields  he wants you to find the minimum amount of money that is needed to make the shields to prevent mr  bobo from succeeding in his evil plan   input first line of input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  then t test cases follow  first line of each test case contains  spaceseparated integers n m and k denoting number of cities the number of bidirectional roads and the cost to make one shield respectively  then m lines follow each containing  spaceseparated integers a and b denoting that there is a road between city a and city b   output for each test case output the minimum amount of money required to fulfill the kings requirements and protect unity of his kingdom   constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤  n− ≤ m ≤ nn−  ≤ a b ≤ n− a ≠ b  ≤ k ≤  the road network has unity no two roads connect the same pair of cities the sum of n in one test file does not exceed                          sample input                                                                     sample output                             explanation  in the sample the cities   and  must be protected by the shields    author jayadm tester ★laycurse editorial  codechef comproblemskingcon tags                                   graphs biconnected components dfs                                                              data structures advanced algorithms advanced graph algos connected components algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
