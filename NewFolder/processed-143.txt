 read problem statements in bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef is trying to invent the light bulb that can run at room temperature without electricity  so he has nn gases numbered from  to n−n− that he can use and he doesnt know which one of the nn gases will work but we do know it  now chef has worked on multiple search algorithms to optimize search  for this project he uses a modulobased search algorithm that he invented himself  so first he chooses an integer kk and selects all indices ii in increasing order such that imodkimodk and test the gases on such indices then all indices ii in increasing order such that imodkimodk and test the gases on such indices and so on  given nn the index of the gas pp that will work and kk find after how much time will he be able to give chefland a new invention assuming that testing  gas takes  day  for example consider npnp and kk   on the stst day chef tests gas numbered  because modmod  on the ndnd day chef tests gas numbered  because modmod  on the rdrd day chef tests gas numbered  because modmod  on the thth day chef tests gas numbered  because modmod  on the thth day chef tests gas numbered  because modmod   so after  days chef will be able to give chefland a new invention input format  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first and only line of each test case contains three spaceseparated integers nn pp and kk   output format for each test case print a single line containing one integer — after how much time chef will be able to give chefland a new invention assuming that testing  gas takes  day  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nk≤≤nk≤ ≤pn≤pn  subtasks subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                  sample output                                explanation test case  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  and on the day  chef will test gas numbered   test case  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  and on the day  chef will test gas numbered   test case  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  and on the day  chef will test gas numbered   test case  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  on the day  chef will test gas numbered  and on the day  chef will test gas numbered    author souradeepadm editorial  codechef comproblemschfinvnt tags                                   arithmetic                                                              mathematics basic maths                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
