 mr  shaurya is a great competitive programmer of nit kurukshetra  he tries his best to teach algorithms and data structures to his juniors in the best possible way  he always gives creative questions to his students so that students never get bored  as this year is bad because of covid he tries to give a problem on coronavirus to his students  he came up with an interesting question  there is a matrix aa of size n∗mn∗m consisting of nn rows and mm columns   the rows are numbered from   n  n and columns are numbered from    m   m  each cell is represented by aaijij  the cell can be empty blocked or contain the deadly coronavirus  the virus can move only in the same row or in the same column until it gets blocked  the virus can only move in empty positions and contaminate the cell  you have to count the number of cells that get contaminated  each cell can contain at most  virus and cells can be contaminated by more than  virus  the cells containing the virus initially are also contaminated  input  the first line consists of a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the second line contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm denoting the number of rows and columns of the matrix  the next nn lines contain mm spaceseparated integers  the integer  denotes empty cell  denotes cell containing a virus and  denotes that the cell is blocked   output for each test case print a single integer on a new line denoting the number of cells contaminated by the corona virus  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nm≤≤nm≤ sum of n∗mn∗m for all test cases ≤≤  sample input                                    sample output    explanation first test case  a can move only in row  and column  i e at position a a a a  thus total contaminated cells are  including a  second test case  a can move at cells only a a a  it cannot move to cell a and to its right because cell a is blocked  similarly a can not move downwards   a can move to a and a   a can move to a a and a  thus total contaminated cells are    author ★vasu editorial  codechef comproblemsencb tags                                   binarysearch dynamicprogramming enco vasu                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
