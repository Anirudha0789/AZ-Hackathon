  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  limak is a little polar bear  he is playing a video game and he needs your help  there is a row with n cells each either empty or occupied by a soldier denoted by  and  respectively  the goal of the game is to move all soldiers to the right they should occupy some number of rightmost cells  the only possible command is choosing a soldier and telling him to move to the right as far as possible  choosing a soldier takes  second and a soldier moves with the speed of a cell per second  the soldier stops immediately if he is in the last cell of the row or the next cell is already occupied  limak isnt allowed to choose a soldier that cant move at all the chosen soldier must move at least one cell to the right  limak enjoys this game very much and wants to play as long as possible  in particular he doesnt start a new command while the previously chosen soldier moves  can you tell him how many seconds he can play at most input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows   the only line of each test case contains a string s describing the row with n cells  each character is either  or  denoting an empty cell or a cell with a soldier respectively   output for each test case output a single line containing one integer — the maximum possible number of seconds limak will play the game  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤  n denotes the length of the string s  subtasks  subtask   points  ≤ n ≤  subtask   points  ≤ n ≤  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                          sample output                                explanation test case   the initial string is   there are n   cells  there is one soldier in the first cell and one soldier in the third cell  the following scenario maximizes the total time  limak chooses the soldier in the first cell  this soldier can move only one cell to the right  it takes  second to choose a soldier and  second for a soldier to move to the next cell  seconds in total  the string is  now  limak has only one choice  he must choose the soldier in the third cell because the other soldier cant move at all the soldier in the second cell cant move to the right because the next cell is already occupied  choosing a soldier takes  second  the chosen soldier moves from the third cell to the fifth cell which takes  seconds  this operation takes      seconds in total  the string is  now  limak has only one choice again  since the soldier in the last row cant move further to the right the soldier in the second cell must be chosen  he will move  cells to the right  this operation takes      seconds in total  the string become  and the game is over   the total time is         test case   the initial string is   there is only one possible scenario   is changed to  in  seconds  second to choose a soldier and  seconds for the soldier to move  cells to the right   is changed to  in  seconds   the total time is      seconds  test case   the game is over immediately because all soldiers occupy rightmost cells already  the answer is    author ★errichto editorial  codechef comproblemsrowsold tags                                   prefix sum                                                              algorithms simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
