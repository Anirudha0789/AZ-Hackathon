 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  if you didnt copy assignments during your engineering course did you even do engineering there are qq students in chefs class  chefs teacher has given the students a simple assignment write a function that takes as arguments an array aa containing only unique elements and a number xx guaranteed to be present in the array and returns the based index of the element that is equal to xx  the teacher was expecting a linear search algorithm but since chef is such an amazing programmer he decided to write the following binary search function integer binarysearcharray a integer n integer x     integer low high mid     low       high  n     while low ≤ high         mid  low  high           if amid  x             break         else if amid is less than x             low  mid         else             high  mid     return mid  all of chefs classmates have copied his code and submitted it to the teacher  chef later realised that since he forgot to sort the array the binary search algorithm may not work  luckily the teacher is tired today so she asked chef to assist her with grading the codes  each students code is graded by providing an array aa and an integer xx to it and checking if the returned index is correct  however the teacher is lazy and provides the exact same array to all codes  the only thing that varies is the value of xx  chef was asked to type in the inputs  he decides that when typing in the input array for each code hes not going to use the input array hes given but an array created by swapping some pairs of elements of this original input array  however he cannot change the position of the element thats equal to xx itself since that would be suspicious  for each of the qq students chef would like to know the minimum number of swaps required to make the algorithm find the correct answer  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and qq denoting the number of elements in the array and the number of students  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an  the following qq lines describe queries  each of these lines contains a single integer xx   output for each query print a single line containing one integer — the minimum required number of swaps or −− if it is impossible to make the algorithm find the correct answer  do you really think chef can fail constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nq≤≤nq≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for each valid ii ≤x≤≤x≤ all elements of aa are pairwise distinct for each query xx is present in aa sum of nn over all test cases ≤⋅≤⋅ sum of qq over all test cases ≤⋅≤⋅  subtasks subtask   points ≤n≤≤n≤ subtask   points  ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for each valid ii ≤x≤≤x≤  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                      sample output                                   explanation example case   query  the algorithm works without any swaps  query  one solution is to swap aa and aa  query  one solution is to swap aa and aa  query  one solution is to swap aa with aa and aa with aa  query  one solution is to swap aa and aa  query  the algorithm works without any swaps  query  the algorithm works without any swaps    author ★abdullah editorial  codechef comproblemsfakebs tags                                   abdullah binarysearch may                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
