 chef hates unoptimized codes and people who write such codes  one fine day he decided to look through the kitchens codebase and found a function whose pseudocode is given here  input integer n list x      n list y      n  output integer res  function  set res   for i   to n do    for j   to n do       for k   to n do          if xi  xj or xj  xk or xk  xi             continue          else             set res  maxres yi  yj  yk return res luckily enough this code gets triggered only if the head chef makes a submission  but still there is a possibility that this can crash the judge  so help chef by writing a new function which does the same thing but is faster  input  the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains an integer n denoting the number of elements in the two lists  the ith of the next n lines contains a pair of spaceseparated integers denoting the values of xi and yi respectively   output for each test case output an integer corresponding to the return value of the function  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ xi yi ≤   example input                     output    explanation testcase  the maximum is attained when i   j   and k    this leads to res being         this value is attained in other iterations as well but it never exceeds this and hence this is the answer   author admin tags                                   greedy constructive                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp  submit
