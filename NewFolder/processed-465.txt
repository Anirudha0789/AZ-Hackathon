 due to covid  has been a tough year for indian students is especially problematic as students need to spend long period in crowded classes where social distancing is difficult to maintain  to minimize the spread of covid each column is separated by  fts   the institution are hoping that by not making any one hub the spread of the virus will be significantly limited  the institute wants to conduct exam and students want to cheat in class  classes normally have n bench in a column  running in various directions  amidst the pandemic each bench has carefully arranged these n benches in a sequence with each assigned a number from  to n  cheating can only be done between pairs of benches that are adjacent in this sequence they can cheat in both directions  that is cheating can be done from bench i to bench j if and only if ∣i−j∣   to make things more complicated some students have their own restrictions on wanting a chit slip and passing a chit slip  these restrictions are indicated by the characters wc  n wanting chits and pc  n passing chit each of which is either n or y  •    if wci  n then incoming slips to bench i from any other bench are disallowed  otherwise if wci  y they may be allowed  •    if pci  n then passing chits from state i to any other bench are disallowed  otherwise if pi  y they may be allowed  as a consulting data scientist of the class your job is to determine which benching between the various benches are possible  let pij  y if its possible to travel from state i to state j via a sequence of   or more trains which may pass through other states along the way and pij  n otherwise  note that pii is always y  output this n∗n matrix of characters   input  input begins with an integer t the number of column in class  for each case there are three lines  the first line contains the integer n number of benches in a column   the second line contains the lengthn string wc  n  the third line contains the lengthn string pc  n   output  for the ith test case output a line containing case i followed by n more lines the ith of which contains the lengthn string pi  n   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  sample input   yy yy  ny yy  nn yy  ynnyy yyyny  nyyynnyyyy yynyynyyny sample output case   yy yy case   yy ny case   yn ny case   ynnnn yynnn nnyyn nnnyn nnnyy case   yyynnnnnnn nyynnnnnnn nnynnnnnnn nnyynnnnnn nnyyynnnnn nnnnnynnnn nnnnnnyyyn nnnnnnyyyn nnnnnnnnyn nnnnnnnnyy  author ★arpit editorial  codechef comproblemschtpndmc tags                                   arpit bruteforce cplusplus graphs greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
