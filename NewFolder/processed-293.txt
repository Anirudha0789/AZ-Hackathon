 problem statement  players cyborg and geno are playing a game on a matrix  in each turn the player choses a number from the matrix which is not selected yet and adds the number to his sum  in the end the player with the largest sum wins the game  assuming both players play optimally and cyborg starts the game predict who will be the winner of the game  assume that the initial sum is  for both the players  input section the first line contains t the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  each test case begin with  integers n and m denoting the number of rows and columns in the matrix  the next n lines contains m space separated integers denoting the numbers present in the matrix  output section for each testcase output cyborg geno or draw based on the outcome of the game  input constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ n m ≤   ≤ aij ≤  where aij denotes the element of the matrix in ith row and jth column                          sample input                                                                         sample output                            cyborg draw cyborg explanation in the first test case cyborg wins by selecting the only number present in the matrix  in the second test case both cyborg and geno will end up with a sum of  irrespective of how they chose the numbers  hence it results in a draw  in the third test case when with the player play optimally cyborg will end up with sum of  while geno will end up with sum of   so cyborg wins the game   author ★likecs editorial  codechef comproblemsicl tags                                   cakewalk greedy icl likecs likecs                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
