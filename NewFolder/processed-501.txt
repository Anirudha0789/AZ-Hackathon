  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  lira and her best friend are now ending highschool and soon they both will head separate ways    lira will obviously study computer science while her best friend will study arts    apparentely opposites attract alikes repel right however as lira didnt want to lose contact with her she decided to mix art and computer science one last time and amaze her friend with computer science so she could have a geek coding partner  to amaze her she encoded a message in two strings which she presented to her friend lira so mary as you can see we have two strings here yes we have a first longer string s which encodes our common path together and is represented by some letters which represent our lives so far as well all the events we lived together  the second string s will be as long as the first one or possibly shorter and it is here to represent what the future might bring to both of us  it is also only composed of letters which represent some life events we might still experience together in the future  what i would like you to do is to find out if the future will be just like now and for thatyou need to find a contiguous sequence of letters in both of these two strings  obviously as i want our friendship to last very very much i ask you to find the longest sequence of life events we might still experience together  and tell me which sequence is it and how long is it d however if fate doesnt want us to be together simply tell me the number  and we shall both head separate ways forever  turns out that after mary solved the problem she became so interested in cs herself that both she and lira are now working together at a very reputable software company    xa input the input will consist of two strings composed only of the letters a  z both of which are at most   characters in length  output the output should be as stated  if there is a common life event in mary and liras lives you should output it on a single line and on another line you should output the length of the event  otherwise simply output   on the case where there are multiple answers the first common event to be found on the second string should be written to output followed by its length  see example  for details  constraints  ≤ s ≤   ≤ s ≤   ≤ s ≤ s the last constraint simply means that s will never be larger than s xa note the mary in this problem is actually a small tribute to my coder friend mary kuchumova which hopefully will return to codechef and get back in touch again  d mary youre missed                          sample input                            adsyufsfdsfdsf fdyusgfdfyu                          sample output                            fd                           sample input                            adsyufsfdsfdsf bbbbbbbbb                          sample output                                                      sample input                            abcdef defabc                          sample output                            def  explanation example case  the longest life event is fd whose length is   example case  the girls will follow separate lives  example case  on the case where multiple events can happen mary will choose the event which is closer to happen in the future and as such answer is def   author brunoadm editorial  codechef comproblemssstory tags                                   suffix automaton hashing binary search on answer                                                              advanced data structures suffix structures algorithms searching binary search                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
