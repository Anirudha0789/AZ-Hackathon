  finally the lazyproblemsetters have decided the way in which they will attempt the questions in the problem set  they have decided to go to the computer lab of the cse department because it has airconditioning and are ready to get their hands dirty with some was and tles   their department has a very unique lab  they have a lot of computers and each student gets a private account which they can access through any of those computers  for this no data is stored on these computers but on dedicated servers and sent to the computer that a student is currently using  this way the students are not forced to sit on particular computers and can choose any place they like that is available   now the department has a home built advanced facial recognition software which they use in this lab  it works as followswhen anyone sits on a computer hisher picture is captured along with the locality and sent to the internal database of the lab where they identify the user associated with that picture and the computer heshe is sitting  after that the data of that user is fetched from the dedicated data servers and sent to the computer   now all this takes time and to keep the user busy they decided to give them a puzzle to solve  if the user solves the puzzle correctly they are allowed to login  the puzzle is as follows  a string s composed of only small case letters of the english alphabet is shown on the screen to the user   then two integers p and q are shown to the users    the user has now to create a string r using s and p by concatenating p copies of s one after another  then r is transformed into its smallest lexicographic permutation i e  all the as are brought to the front and placed there then after that all the bs are placed then cs and so on  this is the final r that the user needs to form   then q numbers appear on the screen one by one  for each number n that appears on the screen the user has to type the character at the nth location of r  if n is greater than the length of r they have to type  without quotes  input the first line consists of an integer t the number of test cases followed by the test cases themselves   each test case begins with the string s in the first line followed by two spaceseparated integers p and q in the next line   then q lines follow each containing an integer n   output for each test case for each integer n print in a new line the character at the nth location of r  or print  without quotes as described above   constraints    ≤ p ≤     ≤ n ≤     ≤ q ≤     ≤ s ≤  where s denotes the length of the string     ≤ t ≤    example input  abcde         output a b d e   note large io be careful with certain languages  author admin editorial  codechef comproblemsacmkn tags                                   acmkan admin array simple                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages java c cpp pyp  submit
