 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  once again we have a lot of requests from coders for a challenging problem on geometry  geometry expert nitin is thinking about a problem with parabolas icosahedrons crescents and trapezoids but for now to encourage beginners he chooses to work with circles and rectangles  you are given two sequences aa…anaa…an and bb…bnbb…bn  you should choose a permutation pp…pnpp…pn of the integers  through nn and construct nn rectangles with dimensions a×bpa×bp…an×bpna×bpa×bp…an×bpn  then for each of these rectangles you should construct an inscribed circle i e  a circle with the maximum possible area that is completely contained in that rectangle  let ss be the sum of diameters of these nn circles  your task is to find the maximum value of ss  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an   the third line contains nn spaceseparated integers bb…bnbb…bn    output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum value of ss  it is guaranteed that this value is always an integer  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤aibi≤≤aibi≤ for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points  aa…anaa…an bb…bnbb…bn  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                      sample output                              explanation example case  four rectangles with dimensions ×× ×× ×× and ×× lead to an optimal answer   author ★sahi editorial  codechef comproblemssnugfit tags                                   geometry greedy                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
