  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef has a rectangular matrix a of nxm integers  rows are numbered by integers from  to n from top to bottom columns  from  to m from left to right  ai j denotes the jth integer of the ith row  chef wants you to guess his matrix  to guess integers you can ask chef questions of next type how many integers from submatrix il ir jl jr are grater than or equal to x and less than or equal to y  by submatrix il ir jl jr we mean all elements ai j for all il ≤ i ≤ ir and jl ≤ j ≤ jr   also chef can answer not more than c questions of next type what is the sum of integers from submatrix il ir jl jr as soon as you think you know the chefs matrix you can stop asking questions and tell to the chef your variant of the matrix  please see scoring part to understand how your solution will be evaluated     input the first line of the input contains three spaceseparated integers n m and c denoting the sizes of the matrix and the maximum number of the secondtype questions  after that the judge will answer your questions and evaluate the resuts  read more about that in the interaction with the judge part of the statement     interaction with the judge to ask a firsttype question you should print to the standard output one line containing seven spaceseparated integers  il ir jl jr x y  to ask a secondtype question you should print one line containing five spaceseparated integers  il ir jl jr  after that you should read from the standard input one integer  answer to the question  to end the game you should print  and starting from next line print n lines each of them contains m spaceseparated integers  your variant of the matrix a  after that your program must stop  remember to flush the output after every line you print    constraints   ≤ n m ≤      ≤ n  m ≤      ≤ c ≤   ≤ ai j ≤   ≤ il ≤ ir ≤ n  ≤ jl ≤ jr ≤ m  ≤ x ≤ y ≤   ≤ number of asked questions ≤     ≤ bi j ≤   ≤ a a a ≤      scoring  let b will be the matrix you output and diff  ∑ ai j  bi j for all  ≤ i ≤ n  ≤ j ≤ m  the number of questions you asked is questions  the number of integers you correctly guessed is correcti  e  the number of elements i j such that ai j  bi j   the score for each test case will be score  a  questions   a  diff   a  n  m  correct  your goal is to minimize this score  your total score for the problem will be the sum of scores on all the test cases    example input          output                                              explanation            a               for this test case a   a   and a    the score for this test case will be                   test data generation  there will be four types of the test files   type  n    m   type  n    m   type  n    m   type  n    m    there will be  test files of each type  during the contest you will be shown the score for only one test file of each type  all elements of matrix a are randomly chosen  for each test case c is randomly chosen from interval       for each test case values a a and a are manually chosen      author ★antoniuk editorial  codechef comproblemschngss tags                                   antoniuk binarysearch challenge march                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
