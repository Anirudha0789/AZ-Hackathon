 there is a company having     e employees working in town     t that you work for  the employees live in n towns in that area  some of the employees drive     p passengers  when p then it means the driver can only transport themselves to work  you want to ensure that everyone     will be able to make it to work and you would like to minimize the number of cars on the road  requirements to calculate the number of cars on the road   every employee can get to town every employee can get to town every employee can get to town an employee can travel in a car belonging to an employee between towns employees can only take rides from other employees that live in same town the minimum number of cars is used  find whether it is possible for everyone to make it to work and if it is how many cars will end up driving to the office  input one line containing an integer c the number of test cases in the input file  for each test case there will be  one line containing the integer n the number of towns in your area and the integer t the town where the office is located  one line containing the integer e the number of employees   e lines one for each employee each containing          o an integer         h   the home town of the employee followed by          o an integer         p   the number of passengers they can drive  if the employee is not licensed to drive the number will be     output c lines one for each test case in the order they occur in the input file followed by      o the string impossible if there are not enough drivers for everyone to commute or      o n spaceseparated integers one for each town from  to n which indicate the number of vehicles commuting from the town  limits  ≤ t ≤ n       ≤ h ≤ n       ≤ p ≤  sample input                                                                                                                      output           impossible            author apurvsinghgaut editorial  codechef comproblemsmkwrk tags                                   apurvsinghgaut sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
