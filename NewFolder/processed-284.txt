 the chef has been hunting for a machine developed to change numbers in a rather peculiar manner  this machine has a fixed number cc associated with it and a changing number xx   in a single step the chef can do the following  first choose any positive integer bb that is a perfect ccth power of some number that is there is some positive integer nn such that bncbnc then change x→lcmbxgcdbxx→lcmbxgcdbx  he wants to find the minimum number he can change xx into by applying these operations alone any number of times possibly none at all  however he does not know the exact values of xcxc for the machine but he does have tt guesses for what these values might be  for each of these guesses compute the minimum number chef can obtain  input format  the first line of input will contain an integer tt the number of guesses chef has for the pair xcxc  then the guesses follow  each guess consists of a single line of input containing two spaceseparated integers xcxc   output format for each guess print on a new line the minimum value that chef can change xx into by applying any number of operations possibly none at all  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤x≤≤x≤ ≤c≤≤c≤                         sample input                                                            sample output                               explanation guess  it can easily be checked that xx cannot be changed  guess  choose bb and change x→lcmgcdx→lcmgcd  this is the minimum possible value of xx   author ★leovaldez editorial  codechef comproblemsgcdlcm tags                                   gcd lcm                                                              mathematics number theory                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
