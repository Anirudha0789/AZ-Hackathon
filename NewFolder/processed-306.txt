 chefland is a dd city where each of the nn houses is located at a distinct positive integer coordinate aa…anaa…an  the chef is planning to create kk hills in the city  note that two hills cannot be present at the same location but the location of hills and houses can overlap and each hill will also be at any integer positive negative or zero coordinate   each citizen would want to travel to the farthest hill from his house  travelling will create air pollution and chef wants to minimise the total pollution in the city  help chef find the minimum sum of distance travelled by everyone  in other words help chef create the hills at optimal locations so that the sum of the distance of every house to the hill farthest from it is minimum possible  input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   each testcase contains two lines of input  first line contains  integers nknk separated by a space  second line contains nn integers aa…anaa…an representing the location of the houses    output for each testcase find the minimum possible sum of distances if chef creates the hills at optimal locations in a separate line  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nk≤≤nk≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ aiai∀aiai∀ valid ii                         sample input                                                                  sample output                               explanation testcase  optimal solution includes creating hill at   its distance from the house at coordinate  is  and so is its distance from the house at coordinate   its distance from the house at coordinate  is   thus total distance is   testcase  optimal solution includes creating hills at −−  the farthest hills from the house at coordinate  are at coordinates −− and   the citizen can choose to travel to any of them and the distance shall be   testcase  optimal solution includes creating hills at  or    author smitadm editorial  codechef comproblemschills tags                                   easy greedy observation smitadm start vichitr                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
