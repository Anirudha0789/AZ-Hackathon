 xa captain america has requested tony for a new shield with a different shape to experiment with  tony decided that he will build a triangular shield for captain  he first decided to build the traingular frame of the shield  to do so he has n segments of vibranium steel alloy the ith of them has a length ai  since vibranium is a rare substance tony can use exactly  segments out of n such that they form a non degenerate triangular frame  he can not concatenate two segments or change the length of any segment  help tony determine if he can use exactly three segments to form a triangular frame or not  xa input  the first line contains a positive integer t denoting the number of test cases  the first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of segments tony has to choose from  the second line of each test case contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an denoting the length of the segments    xa output for each test case output in a single line yes if tony can form a nondegenerate triangular frame using exactly three segments and no otherwise  xa constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ ai ≤   xa example input             output yes no xa  author ★varuns editorial  codechef comproblemscaptain tags                                   cakewalk constructive greedy sorting varuns                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
