  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  as part of a new program to attract tourists to byteland chef has been placed in charge of organizing a series of bus tours around the city   there are n scenic locations points on the plane in byteland numbered  through n and m bidirectional scenic roads each of which connects two scenic locations via a straight line  chef wishes to organize the tours according to the following rules  a tour is defined as sequence of locations where a tour bus begins at the first location and moves directly from each location to the next location in the sequence until it reaches the last location  there must be a scenic road between consecutive locations  a tour does not have to start and end at the same location but it is allowed  a tour cannot visit the same location more than once with the possible exception of the startend location  a tour cannot cross itself  that is none of the roads belonging to a tour may intersect  each road must be visited by exactly one tour   setting up tours is expensive so chef wishes to minimize the total number of tours   optimal solutions are not required but solutions that use fewer tours will score more points see the scoring section below   however your solution must use at most nm tours or else it will be judged wrong answer  input input will begin with a line containing an integer n   following this will be n lines containing the locations of the n scenic locations   each location is given as a pair of integers with the ith line giving xi and yi the respective x and y coordinates of the ith scenic location  following this will be n lines containing n characters each   the ith character of the jth line will be y if there is a scenic road connecting locations i and j and n otherwise  output first print an integer k the number of tours   then print k tour descriptions   each tour description should consist of an integer l the length of the tour in roads followed by l integers the ordinal numbers of the locations on the tour in order  scoring your score is knm   lower scores will earn more points  we have  official test files  you must correctly solve all test files to receive ok  during the contest your overall score is the sum of the scores on the first  test files  after the contest all solutions will be rescored by the sum of the scores on the rest  test files  note that public part of the tests can not contain some border cases  constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ xi yi ≤  no three points will be collinear  the ith character of the ith row of the road descriptions will be n  the ith character of the jth row of the road descriptions will equal the jth character of the ith row  each city will be connected to at least one road   sample input              nnnyny nnyynn nynyyn yyynyn nnyyny ynnnyn  sample output                this sample output would score     points  test case generation n will be chosen randomly and uniformly between  and  inclusive   each points coordinates are chosen randomly and uniformly between  and  inclusive   if two points coincide or three points are collinear the process is restarted with the same value of n  a real value p is chosen randomly and uniformly between   and     between each pair of cities a road exists with probability p   if some city has no roads the process is restarted with the same value of p   author davidadm tester ★whiteking editorial  codechef comproblemstourbus tags                                   challenge davidadm dynamicprogramming greedy heuristic jan search                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
