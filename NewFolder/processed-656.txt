 you are mayor of kolkata and youve decided to create a new town in the outskirts of the city this new town is very well planned  all the houses in the town are arranged in a rectangle of dimensions n  m i e  there are n rows of houses with each row containing m houses  the contract of painting the houses was given to a company brute inc which did a rather lousy job  it had to paint all the houses in either red blue or green color but they left some of the houses unpainted  when you saw the shoddy work done by the contractor you decided to give the task of completing the unfinished painting work to another company entropy inc  this company works in a rather weird way it paints each unpainted house with either red blue or green color uniformly at random   consider any square shaped subgrid of houses in this rectangular town  it can be uniquely represented by the top left house and the bottom right house  this subgrid of houses will be called beautiful if all the houses in it have the same color  the overall beauty of the town will be equal to the total number of beautiful square subgrids in the town  your task is to find expected beauty of the town after the painting work is completed  a subgrid of houses can be uniquely defined by the coordinates of top left and bottom right houses i e  x y and x y respectively  the houses that lie in the subgrid will be the ones that have their coordinates x y satisfy both x ≤ x ≤ x and y ≤ y ≤ y  this subgrid will be a square subgrid if x  x  y  y  in particular    cell is also called a square subgrid  top left house of the town has coordinates   and bottom right house has coordinates n m   input there is a single test case  the first line of the input contains two space separated integers n m denoting dimensions of town  each of the next n lines contains a string consisting of m characters each of them can be r denoting red color g denoting green color b denoting blue color or  denoting unpainted house  output output a single real number corresponding to the expected beauty of the town after the painting of the houses  your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error is within e of the answer  constraints   ≤ n m ≤   example  input   rr rr  output   explanation there are total  square subgrids of houses in the town  all of them painted with same color  so beauty of the town will be   example  input   r rr  output    explanation the unpainted house can be painted with any of the red green blue colors uniformly randomly    it is colored red in this case beauty of town will be   it is colored green in this case beauty of town will be   it is colored blue in this case beauty of town will be   hence expected beauty of the town will be                  author admin tags                                   admin binarysearch breadthfirstsearch bruteforce expectedvalue icpc kgp precomputation probability                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp  submit
