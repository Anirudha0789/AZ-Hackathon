                        the currency of dholakpur is pretty awesome  there notes have values   c c c       the sequence goes on till infinity so notes have unbounded values   little bheem is a resident of dholakpur and runs a laddu shop  he always keeps infinite number of notes of each value with him but pays using minimum number of notes  for example if c   and he has to pay  rupees he will pay using one note of value  one note of value  and two notes of value   he cannot pay  rupees with fewer than four notes   bheem is wondering what is kth smallest amount which if paid using fewest possible notes would require exactly s notes   input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  each test is descried by exactly one lines containing three space separated integers c s and k   output for each test case output a separate line containing the required answer   constraints   ≤ t ≤    ≤ c ≤    ≤ s ≤    ≤ k ≤   the answer will be at most   subtask   points k   the answer will be at most  time limit is  seconds   subtask   points c   the answer will be at most  time limit is  seconds   subtask   points k is small  formally kc ≤ s the answer will be at most  time limit is  seconds   subtask   points  the answer will be at most  time limit is  seconds   subtask   points   no special constraints  time limit is   seconds   sample input            sample output    explanation for test case  all the amounts which require exactly  note are         for test case  all the amounts which require exactly  notes are           for test case  all the amounts which require exactly  notes are           author ★utkarshlath tester  editorial  codechef comproblemscoinchng tags                                   dynamic programming greedy binary search                                                              algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit     secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
