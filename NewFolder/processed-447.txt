 bob and alice are very close friends  once they decided to go to a shop to buy strings for themselves  the strings available in the shop contain only lowercase latin letters  alice and bob decided to buy strings of the same length nn  they also wanted the strings to be equal  it is guaranteed that the shop has at least two strings of the length nn  but its not guaranteed that the shop has two equal strings  hence they decided to exchange characters among themselves to make the strings equal  let the two strings they bought be represented by aa and bb  for all ii such that ≤i≤n≤i≤n they can perform the following operations on the strings any number of times   swap aiai with bibi swap aiai with an−ian−i  you have to tell the minimum number of operations needed to make the strings equal  or determine that its impossible  input  first line will contain tt the number of test cases  then tt the test cases follow   first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  second line of each test case contains a single string aa  thrid line of each test case contains a single string bb   output for each test case output in a single line the required answer  if it not possible to make the strings equal print   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ abnabn strings contain only lowercase latin letters  sample input   wbbw rbbr  r z   sample output      author ★sibasish editorial  codechef comproblemsthetrade tags                                   ftcf greedy sibasish sibasish simple                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
