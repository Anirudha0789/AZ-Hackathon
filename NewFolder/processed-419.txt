 in quartzland recently a new collection of toys went on sale  this collection consists of    types of toys numbered with integers from    to     a toy from the new collection of the  ixadth type costs  i  quartz  riku has managed to collect n  different types of toys  a  a    an  from the new collection  today is rikus birthday and her mother decided to spend no more than m  quartz on the gift to the daughter  riku will choose several different types of toys from the new collection as a gift  of course she does not want to get a type of toy which she already has  riku wants to have as many distinct types of toys in her collection as possible as the result  the new collection is too diverse and riku is too little so she asks you to help her in this  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains  space separated integers n and  m — the number of types of toys that riku already has and the number of quartz that her mom is willing to spend on buying new toys  the second line contains  n  distinct integers  a  a   an — the types of toys that riku already has   output for each test case output two lines as follows in the first line print a single integer  k  — the number of different types of toys that riku should choose so that the number of different types of toys in her collection is maximum possible  of course the total cost of the selected toys should not exceed m  in the second line print  k  distinct spacexad separated integers  x  x    xk— the types of toys that riku should choose  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ m ≤   ≤ ai ≤   ≤ xi ≤   example input               output          explanation example case   rikus mom should buy two toys one toy of the  xadnd type and one toy of the  xadth type  at any other purchase for    quartz assuming that the toys of types       and    have already been bought it is impossible to buy two and more toys   author ★puneetguptaa editorial  codechef comproblemscdx tags                                   easy greedy implementation puneetguptaa                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
