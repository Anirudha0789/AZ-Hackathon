 xa raman and himanshu are good friends  one day himanshu gave him a problem  there are infinite number of buckets and n litres of water xathese buckets have a unique property  the capacity of ith bucket is i litres i e  the capacity of first bucket is  litre the capacity of second bucket is  litres and so on  also the ith bucket can only be filled when all the buckets which have lesser capacity are totally filled i e  second bucket cannot be filled before first bucket    now himanshu wants him to find the number of buckets which can be filled with n litres of water   so raman is asking for your help  he wants you to write a program to find the solution of the given problem  the bucket will be considered filled if it has atleast  litre in it  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows   each test case contain a integer n denoting the amount of water in litres  xa output for each test case output a single integer which denotes the number of buckets which can be filled  constraints should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have  format it like   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   xa example input      output    xa explanation example case   in this case we can fill the first bucket in  litre and second bucket in  litres  now we are not left with any amount of water  so the ans is     author ★hsagarthegr editorial  codechef comproblemsbitmask tags                                   binarysearch hsagarthegr search                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
