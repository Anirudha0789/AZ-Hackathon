 given  string ss ss and xx find the number of nonempty substrings of xx which can expressed as pqpq i e  concatenation of strings pp and qq where pp is some prefix of ss possibly empty and qq is some prefix of ss possibly empty  a substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string  for example chef is a substring of codechef but def is not  a prefix of a string ss is a substring of ss that occurs at the beginning of ss  for example code is a prefix of codechef but chef is not  also an empty string is a prefix of any string  input format  first line of the input contains tt the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  each test case contains three lines string ss in the first line string ss in the second line and string xx in the third line  all strings consist of only lowercase latin letters   output format for each test case print a single line containing one integer denoting the number of substrings of xx that satisfy the above conditions  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤xss≤≤xss≤ sum of xx over all test cases doesnt exceed   sum of ss over all test cases doesnt exceed   sum of ss over all test cases doesnt exceed                           sample input                             ab bc abc aa bb ab aab acb bcaabacbc                          sample output                               explanation test case  there are  substrings of xabcxabc namely abcabbcabcabcabbcabc   observe that aa is a prefix of sabsab and an empty string is a prefix of sbcsbc  by concatenating them we get the string aa  now an empty string is a prefix of ss and bb is a prefix of ss  and by concatenating them we get the string bb  observe that there is no prefix of ss starting with cc and also no prefix of ss starting with cc  so we cannot express the string cc as a concatenation of prefixes  the string abab is a prefix of ss and an empty string is a prefix of ss  and by concatenation we get abab  similarly an empty string is a prefix of ss and bcbc is a prefix of ss  and by concatenating them we get bcbc  finally by taking the prefix aa of ss and the prefix bcbc of ss we get abcabc when we concatenate them   so all substrings of xx except for the substring cc can be expressed as a concatenation of some prefix of ss and some prefix of ss  therefore the answer for this test case is   test case  there are  substrings of xabxab namely abababab   observe that aa is a prefix of saasaa and an empty string is a prefix of sbbsbb  by concatenating them we get the string aa  an empty string is a prefix of ss and bb is a prefix of ss  and by concatenating them we get the string bb  finally by taking the prefix aa of ss and the prefix bb of ss we get abab when we concatenate them   so all substrings of xx can be expressed as a concatenation of some prefix of ss and some prefix of ss  therefore the answer for this test case is    author suryaprakadm editorial  codechef comproblemssstrpref tags                                   sparse table segment trees pre processing z algorithm range minimum queries                                                              advanced data structures advanced tree structures advanced algorithms string matching algorithms queries                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
