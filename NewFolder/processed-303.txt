 there is a planet named “ruizland” having nn cities these cities are connected in the form of a tree by a bidirectional path of specified lengthin miles  cities are numbered from  to nn  city number  is the capital city  mm pilgrims started their journey from the capital city having initial energy ee…emee…em respectively which reduces on moving from one city to another by a certain amountaa  aa is calculated as follows  consider two cities uu and vv having an edge length of kk miles  the total number of distinct cities from the capital city to the city uu is dd city uu and capital city both are inclusive  if a pilgrim moves from city uu to vv then ak∗dak∗d   out of nn cities there are some special cities except the capital city that are connected to only one city  all pilgrims want to reach any of the special cities  a pilgrim will stop his journey as soon as the energy of the pilgrims becomes  or reaches any of the special cities  initially all cities have  pilgrims except the capital city  find the maximum count of special cities that is nonempty at least one pilgrim is present after the end of the journey of all the pilgrims given that pilgrims are allowed to take any path during their journey  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two integers nn and mm separated by space where nn is the number of cities and mm is the number of pilgrims  the second line contains mm integers separated by spaces denoting the initial energy of the pilgrims  next n−n− lines consists of three integers uu vv and kk separated by space where city uu and vv are connected by a bidirectional path whose length is kk miles  output  for each test case print the maximum count of special cities that is nonempty at least one pilgrim is present after the end of the journey of all the pilgrims   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤ei≤≤ei≤ ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n ≤k≤≤k≤ it is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   it is guaranteed that the sum of mm over all test cases does not exceed                           sample input                                                                           sample output                             explanation there are  special cities namely  and   the energy expected to reach these special cities are  and  respectively  special city  cannot be reached by any pilgrim  if pilgrim  goes to the special city  and pilgrim  goes to the special city  then the maximum number of nonempty special cities is    author ★adikrsingh editorial  codechef comproblemspilgrims tags                                   trees dynamic programming greedy dfs bfs sorting                                                              data structures graphs algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
