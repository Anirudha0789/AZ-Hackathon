 you are given n lines which extend indefinitely in both directions on the xy plane  some of these lines intersect with each other and others dont parallel lines  we call each such intersection an intersection point  you have to find the kth intersection from the bottom  in particular you have to output the smallest value v such that there are at least k intersection points whose ycoordinate is ≤ v  if m lines intersect at a particular point that point is counted mm times  that is if only two lines intersect at a point it is counted as one intersection point  but if three lines intersect at the same point it is counted as  intersection points one for each pair  you are guaranteed that all the n lines are distinct and that there are at least k intersection points between the lines   input format  the first line contains the two integers n and k  the next n lines contain two space separated integers each  the ith line contains mi and ci such that the equation y  mix  ci denotes the ith line   output format  output one value denoting v as defined in the problem which should be within  of the correct answer   constraints   ≤ n ≤  k  ≥  it is guaranteed that there are at least k intersection points  that is  ≤ k ≤ number of intersection points in the input data  ≤ mi ≤  and mi ≠   ≤ ci ≤  it is guaranteed that there are no i and j such that i ≠ j and mi  mj and ci  cj  example input             output     explanation there are  intersection points in total  therefore we want the ycoordinate of the highest intersection point  we see that the highest intersection point is    and hence the answer is     input             output      author ★arjunarul editorial  codechef comproblemschnd tags                                   acmchn arjunarul binarysearch fenwicktree intersections inversions medium segmenttree                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp  submit
