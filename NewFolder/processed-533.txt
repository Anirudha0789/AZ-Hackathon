 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  this is an interactive problem  incase you are new to interactive problems take a look at this link  alice and bob are playing a game  initially alice has a hidden integer xx bob only knows an integer nn such that ≤x≤n≤x≤n and he has to find xx by asking questions  in each question bob must choose an integer yy ≤y≤n≤y≤n and alice answers g l or e based on whether xyxy xyxy or xyxy respectively  however to make things more interesting they decided that alice can lie sometimes  in particular she cannot lie two times in a row and when xyxy i e  bob found xx she has to answer e so lying corresponds to answering g when the correct answer is l or vice versa  alice can choose to lie at any time as long as she follows these rules  as soon as alice answers e to some question the game ends and bob wins  help bob and win the game using no more than kk questions  note the grader is adaptive ― the answer is not fixed at the start but the answers to your questions are chosen in such a way that there is always at least one integer xx which is consistent with all answers for some valid choice of answers that are lies  interaction  first you should read a line containing a single integer nn  then you should ask questions  to ask a question print a line containing a single integer yy  then you must read a line containing a single character g l or e denoting the answer to your question  as soon as the answer to one of your questions is e you must terminate your program   constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤  subtasks subtask   points   kk alice follows a simpler strategy she either answers the second fourth sixth etc  question or the first third fifth etc  question truthfully but she may or may not lie in all other questions  subtask   points  kk n≤n≤  subtask   points kk subtask   points kk example grader              you                       l                      g                      g                      e  explanation the hidden number is xx  alice decides to lie in the first question so she has to tell the truth in the second question  in the third question she decides to tell the truth and in the final question she answers e since bob asks about the correct value   author arthurfn editorial  codechef comproblemsguessg tags                                   adhoc binary search                                                              algorithms constructive searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
