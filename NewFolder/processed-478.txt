  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef is the head of commercial logging industry that recently bought a farm containing n trees  you are given initial height of the ith tree by hi and the rate of growth of height as ri meters per month  for simplicity you can assume that all the trees are perfect cylinders of equal radius  this allows us to consider only the height of trees when we talk about the amount of wood   in chefs country laws dont allow one to cut a tree partially so one has to cut the tree completely for gathering wood  also laws prohibit cutting trees of heights strictly lower than l meters   today chef received an order of w meters of height of wood  chef wants to deliver this order as soon as possible  find out how minimum number of months he should wait after which he will able to fulfill the order  you can assume that chefs companys sawing machines are very efficient and take negligible amount of time to cut the trees   input there is a single test case per test file  the first line of the input contains three space separated integers n w and l denoting the number of trees in the farm the amount of wood in meters that have to be gathered and the minimum allowed height of the tree to cut  each of next n lines contain two space separated integers denoting hi and ri respectively  output output a single integer denoting the number of months that have to pass before chef will be able to fulfill the order  constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ w l ≤   ≤ hi ri ≤   subtasks  subtask   points  ≤  n w l ≤  subtask   points no additional constraints                         sample input                                                              sample output                             explanation after  months heights of each tree will be   and  respectively  chef is allowed to cut only the third tree sadly it is not enough to fulfill an order of  meters of wood  after  months heights of each tree will be   and  respectively  now chef is allowed to cut second and third trees  cutting both of them would provide him  meters of wood which is enough to fulfill the order    author ★cenadar tester ★kevinsogo editorial  codechef comproblemsforestga tags                                   binary search on answer                                                              algorithms searching binary search                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
