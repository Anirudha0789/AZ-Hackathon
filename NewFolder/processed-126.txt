 finally after purchasing a water cooler during the april long challenge chef noticed that his water cooler requires  liters of water to cool for one hour  how much water in liters would be required by the cooler to cool for nn hours input format  the first line of input will contain an integer tt — the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first and only line of each test case contains an integer nn as described in the problem statement    output format for each test case output the number of liters of water required by the water cooler to cool for nn hours   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤                         sample input                                                        sample output                              explanation test case  as mentioned in the problem statement  liters of water is required by the water cooler to cool for  hour   test case   liters of water is required by the water cooler to cool for  hours   author lavishadm editorial  codechef comproblemswaterreq tags                                   cakewalk lavishadm math start                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
