 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  in some faraway land there is a man named gii who is often considered the coolest person that has ever lived  one saturday evening he decided to go to a club on the other side of his town  the town is shaped like a grid with nn rows numbered  through nn and nn columns numbered  through nn where each cell represents a neighbourhood in the city  lets denote the cell in row rr and column cc by rcrc  gii lives in the cell  and the club is in the cell nnnn  gii also has some friends that live in the city lets denote the number of giis friends in cell ijij by aijaij  of course if gii is in some cell he can move directly to another cell only if it shares a side with his current cell  also he is in quite a rush so he will never increase his distance from the club  more formally from a cell ijij he may only move to the cell ijij or ijij moving outside the grid is not allowed  whenever gii passes through some neighbourhood including the one where he lives and the one with the club all his friends from that neighbourhood decide to go to the club with him since he is so cool  however there is a problem the maximum capacity of the club is xx people so gii may only bring along at most xx of his friends  chef the clubs bouncer is very strict in imposing this rule for safety reasons and gii does not want to leave any friends outside so he wants to choose his route to the club in such a way that the number of his friends that arrive at the club with him does not exceed xx  now gii is wondering what is the number of different routes he can take to the club such that he does not bring more than xx people with him of course he could immediately calculate this number but he has better things to do so he asked you to do it instead  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and xx  nn lines follow  for each ii ≤i≤n≤i≤n the iith of these lines contains nn spaceseparated integers aiai…ainaiai…ain   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the number of ways for gii to reach the club  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤x≤≤x≤ ≤aij≤≤aij≤ for each valid ijij  subtasks subtask   points n≤n≤ subtask   points x≤x≤ subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                                            sample output                              explanation example case  it takes gii exactly four moves to get to the club  he has to avoid the  neighbourhood since bringing all his friends from there would immediately exceed the limit  there are only two routes that avoid this neighbourhood and both of them satisfy chefs demands   where gii brings  friends  where gii brings  friends   author thesitzr tags                                   meet in the middle binary search                                                              algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
