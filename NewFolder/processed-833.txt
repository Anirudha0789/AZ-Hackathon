 xa one night mr x and mr y were playing a game  to test mr ys intelligence mr x gives him an interesting problem to solve   he gives him a number n and asks him to swap the digits in the number such that a smallest number m is obtained without leading zeroes  mr y thinks this is an easy problem to solve and immediately gives the answer  the number can be large therefore mr x wants to check mr ys answer by writing a program for this problem  since mr x is not so good in programming therefore he asks for your help in doing so  xa input  the first line of input contains t the number of test cases  the first line of each test case contains one integer n without leading zeroes  the second line will contain one integer m — mr ys answer   xa output  for each test case output ac if mr ys answer is correct otherwise wa without quotes   xa constraints should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have  format it like   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ m ≤   xa example input       output ac wa  xa explanation self explanatory  author ★rjohari editorial  codechef comproblemsclco tags                                   cakewalk clco easy externalcontest rjohari sorting strings                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
