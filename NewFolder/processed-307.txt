 there are mm levels for a building numbered from  to mm from top to bottom each level having nn parking spots numbered from  to nn from left to right  some spots might have a car while other may be empty the information of which is given in form of two dimensional character array cc cijcij denote parking spot at jjth position on iith level  there is a thief who wants to unlock all the cars  now he is skilled such that for the first time he can directly reach in any parking spot in no time  basically he can reach the first car to be stolen in  time  now he can move within the parking lot only in following manner each taking  unit of time  move down a level  that is if current position is ijij then he reaches ijij if current position is ijij and if ii is odd then he can move from ijij to ijij ii is even then he can move from ijij to ij−ij−  note that he wants to unlock the cars in minimum time and the car is unlocked as soon as the thief reaches that parking spot if the parking lot is empty then the time taken is considered to be     find the minimum time when all the cars would be unlocked  note that once all cars are unlocked the thief can escape instantly so this time does not count  input   the first line of input contains a single integer tt number of test cases  first liine of each test case contains mm and nnnumber of levels and spots per each level   next mm line contains nn space separated characters cici…cincici…cin  where ≤i≤m≤i≤m and cijcij is either ′p′′p′ or ′n′′n′ without quotes  if the spot contains ′p′′p′ then a car is parked there  else it’s not parked   output  for each test case print a single integer the minimum time in which thief can unlock all cars  constraints   ≤t≤ ≤t≤   ≤mn≤≤mn≤   subtasks   subtask   points ≤m≤ ≤m≤   subtask   points original constraints  sample input     n p n n p n n p n n n p n n n p n n n n   n p p p p p  p p n  sample output     explanation in the first case he will select the spot  and the path he takes will be →→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→ so he takes  steps to unlock all the cars  in the second case he will select the spot  and the path he takes will be →→→→→→→→→→→→  so he takes  steps   author ★imreallyjohn editorial  codechef comproblemscarlot tags                                   chptrs greedy imreallyjohn matrices                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
