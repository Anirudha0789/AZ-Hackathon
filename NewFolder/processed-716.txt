 ratan singh and alauddin khilji are bloodenemies of each other  ratan singh has a diverse and well planned kingdom  his kingdom has nn provinces  every province has a  bidirectional road to every other province except itself of course  but alauddin has now attacked his kingdom  during his attack he destroyed some of the roads connecting provinces  to fight back ratan singh divided his senaarmy into two senas  sena xx and sena yy  sena xx has the best warriors while sena yy doesn’t  according to his plan each province should be protected by exactly one of the two senas xx or yy  as sena xx is very strong ratan singh will place them in such a way that   no two adjacent provinces provinces connected by a road are guarded by sena xx   if a province pp is guarded by sena xx then all the provinces which are guarded by sena yy needs to be adjacent to province pp   there should exist at least one province having sena xx and at least one province having sena yy   this way he can ensure the safety of his kingdom  you are the only programmer that khilji has  you have to help him calculate the number of possible ways in which ratan singh can achieve the aforementioned task note  please use fast io methods as the input can be large  input format  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow  first line of each testcase consists of two spaced integers nn and mm denoting the number of provinces in ratan singhs kingdom and the number of roads destroyed by khilji respectively  then mm lines follow each of these lines consists of two spaced integers uu vv denoting that the road connecting provinces uu and vv has been destroyed by khilji    output format for each testcase print the number of possible ways in which ratan singh can deploy his senas following the conditions mentioned in the statement  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ ≤m≤minn⋅n−⋅≤m≤minn⋅n−⋅ u≠vu≠v  all the edges mentioned in the input are unique  the sum of nn over all cases doesnt exceed ⋅⋅ the sum of mm over all cases doesnt exceed ⋅⋅                          sample input                                                                  sample output                             explanation  the only possible way to deploy the senas is deploy the sena xx at provinces  and the ena yy at provinces    for any of the provinces having sena xx it can be seen that every province of sena yy is adjacent to it  province  is adjacent to  the same follows for the province   he cannot deploy sena xx at  and yy at  because in the resulting graph provinces  as well as provinces  are adjacent    author ★needforcode editorial  codechef comproblemskingatck tags                                   graphs connected components dfs bfs                                                              data structures advanced algorithms advanced graph algos algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
