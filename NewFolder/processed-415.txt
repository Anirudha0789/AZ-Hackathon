  read problems statements in mandarin chinese   russian and vietnamese we all wonder who the first person created by god was  different religions tell different stories but alas we are not yet sure about it  but in chefland the home of the species homo chefians even children know that chef shefu was the first chef manufactured by the hands of god  then shefu had some children then his children had some more and now there are a lot of chefs living in chefland  the strange world that chefland is every chef there lives for exactly  years and does not need to have sex for producing children  so a single chef itself can give birth to many chefs  also giving birth to children is deadly for homo chefians  so they only give birth at the end of their  year lifespan  hence every generation has to die to produce the next one  lets call chef shefu to be the st generation chef its children nd generation chefs and so on till the lth generation which is the current generation of chefs  till now there have been n chefs in total in chefland and each has distinct identifier from  to n  the identifier for shefu is   you also know the parentchild relationship   devu is a chef eating monster who also happens to like scifi style adventures  one day he built a time machine and went on a tour back in time visiting various generations of chef  whenever he travels to a generation he organises a contest to test the chefs cooking skills  first devu eats all the food prepared by the chefs then he also eats the chef who prepared the worst food  now all the future generations of the chef that was eaten are never born because their ancestor is killed in history   note that devu does not visit a generation more than once because he doesnt want to create weird time travel paradoxes  after completing his adventures he told his little brother amit about the generations he visited  you are given the information of generations visited via an array a having k distinct integers  ≤ k ≤ l  however amit does not know the exact order in which devu has paid his visits to the generations  little amit is really worried and wishes to complain to his dad churu bhaiya and stop devus evil plans once and for all  churu bhaiya being a mathematician though always insists on exact facts and figures  to force him to foil devus plans amit needs to tell his father the least number of chefs who may have been affected by this misadventure either they are killed or they are never born because their ancestors are killed  can you please help amit in finding out what could be the minimum number of chefs affected due to devus misadventure please do this before devu starts a quest eating homo sapiens from the past as well  hurry up input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains an integer n  in the next n   lines each line contains two space separated integers u v denoting a parent child relation between the two that is u is vs parent or v is us parent  the next line contains a single integer denoting k  the final line for each test case contains k space separated integers denoting array a  output for each test case output a single integer corresponding to the minimum number of chefs affected in devus misadventure  constraints   ≤ t n ≤   ≤ k ≤ l where l denotes the number of generations of chefs   ≤ u v ≤ n u  v  ≤ ai ≤ l all elements in array a are distinct  sum of n over all the test cases in a single file will not exceed    example input                      output    explanation in the first example minimum number of chefs affected are  i e  devu kills chef  in nd generation and one of the chefs out of  and  in rd generation   in the second example minimum number of chefs affected are  i e  devu kills one of the chefs out of  or  in nd generation    author admin editorial  codechef comproblemstimetrav tags                                   admin dynamicprogramming greedy snckfl treeroot                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
