 read problem statements in mandarin bengali russian and vietnamese as well  you are given a sequence aa…anaa…an  consider every pair that consists of  one of the longest nondecreasing subsequences of aa   one of the longest nonincreasing subsequences of aa   find the maximum possible length of the longest common subsequence of the two sequences in such a pair  input format  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains an integer nn  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an   output format  for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible length of the longest common subsequence of any longest nondecreasing subsequence of aa and any longest nonincreasing subsequence of aa   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅ ≤ai≤n≤ai≤n for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points   t≤t≤ n≤n≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed  the numbers in the sequence aa are pairwise distinct  subtask   points   t≤t≤ n≤n≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                                     sample output                                explanation example case  no pair of subsequences containing one of the longest nondecreasing subsequences and one of longest nonincreasing subsequences have a number in common  hence the answer is   example case  the maximum length of the longest common subsequence is  and it can be achieved by choosing the longest nondecreasing subsequence  and the longest nonincreasing subsequence   the longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is   example case  the maximum length of the longest common subsequence is  and it can be achieved by choosing the longest nondecreasing subsequence  and the longest nonincreasing subsequence   the longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is   example case  the maximum length of the longest common subsequence is  and it can be achieved by choosing the longest nondecreasing subsequence  and the longest nonincreasing subsequence   the longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is    author ★losmi editorial  codechef comproblemssublcs tags                                   d arrays longest increasing subsequence greedy                                                              data structures arrays algorithms dynamic programming dp on sequences                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
