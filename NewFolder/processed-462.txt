 having solved the first problem chefs wife has decided to make things tough for him she tells him the following things about the kthkth power of a string                   the kthkth power of a string ii is denoted as ikik and the string ikik is obtained by concatenating kk copies of the string ii  the string ikik iikik i where  denotes concatenation and i is an empty string  the chef is given a string s it is required to measure how ‘far’ it is from the kth power of some string                                                                                 however this time the chef is also allowed to add characters at the end of the string along with replacing existing characters  this time only the string is given and the chef has to find the minimum number of operations needed to change the string into a power of some string  an operation is either a replacement or addition of a character at the end  note that k must be at least  otherwise the answer can always be   help chef solve this problem  input the first line of input will contain the given string  it can be assumed that the characters in the string are all small letters a   z a   z  output this should contain two numbers the minimum number of operations required and the value of k such that the string is converted to a kth power  if there is more than one possible value of k with the same number of operations output the smallest one  constraints  length of ss kk time limit secondsseconds  sample input  abaababa  sample input  abcabcab   sample output    sample output    explanation for sample test  we can add  characters ab at the end of the string  so the new string becomes abaababaab which is the nd power of string abaab  we can see that minimum operations will be  and minimum value of k is   explanation for sample test  we can add  character c at the end of the string  so the new string become abcabcabc which is the rd power of string abc  we can see that minimum operations will be  and minimum value of k is    author ★beast editorial  codechef comproblemschefstr tags                                   beast greedy math mediumhard strings                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
