 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  on a sunny day akbar and birbal were taking a leisurely walk in palace gardens  suddenly akbar noticed a bunch of sticks on the ground and decided to test birbals wits  there are nn stick holders with negligible size numbered  through nn in a row on the ground  akbar places all the sticks in them vertically for each valid ii the initial height of the stick in the iith holder is aiai  birbal has a stick cutter and his task is to completely cut all these sticks i e  reduce the heights of all sticks to   he may perform zero or more operations in each operation he should do the following  choose an integer hh and fix the cutter at the height hh above the ground  the cutter moves from the st to the nnth stick holder  whenever it encounters a stick whose current height is greater than hh it cuts this stick down to height hh i e  for a stick with height hhhh it removes its upper part with length h−hh−h  all the upper parts of sticks that are cut in one operation must have equal lengths  otherwise the operation may not be performed   for example if the heights of sticks are initially  then some valid values for hh in the first operation are  and  ― the cutter cuts the upper parts of two sticks and their lengths are  and  respectively  hh is an invalid choice because it would cut the upper parts of all three sticks with lengths  which are not all equal  akbar wants birbal to completely cut all sticks in the minimum possible number of operations  if you want to be friends with birbal help him solve the problem  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of operations needed to completely cut all the sticks  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points n≤n≤ subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                          sample output                             explanation example case  birbal may perform the following three operations  fix the cutter at hh  the heights of the sticks after this operation are   fix the cutter at hh  the heights of the sticks after this operation are   fix the cutter at hh  after this operation all sticks are completely cut    author ★sahi editorial  codechef comproblemstree tags                                   arrays observation implementation                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
