 chef has nn items in his shop numbered  through nn and for each valid ii iinn        the weight of the i−thi−th item is wiwi  since chef is very sensitive in nature  chef wants to arrange all even weights items one side and odd weights items on another side  chef can arrange two adjacent items with help of swapping at one operation  chef wants a minimum number of operations required to arrange all even weights item on one side and all odd weights item to the another side  chef can’t solve this problem so he asks you to solve it  help chef to solve this problem  input  firstline will contain tt number of test cases  then the test cases follow   the first line of each test case contains a single line integer nn  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers wwww…wnwn  output print the minimum number of operations required chef can make it  if chef cant take any operations print   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤wi≤≤wi≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅  sample input                    sample output     explanation example case   you can arrange all even numbers right side   numbers of swaps  arrange at position thth is  operations  arrange at position thth is  operations  arrange at position thth is  operations  given array  to  total         operations example case  initially all odd number one side and all even number another side so minimum number of operations     author thertucoders editorial  codechef comproblemschefrtu tags                                   cbiz easy greedy thertucoders                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
