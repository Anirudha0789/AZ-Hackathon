 jj challenges his friend gg to construct an array aa containing nn distinct elements such that the following conditions hold  for all ≤i≤n≤i≤n ≤ai≤≤ai≤ for every subarray of length ≥≥ the sum of all the elements of the subarray is not divisible by the length of the subarray  please help perplexed gg to complete jjs challenge  input format  the first line contains tt  the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  the first and only line of each test case contains an integer nn  the size of the array aa to be constructed   output format for each test case output an array aa containing nn distinct elements which satisfy the given conditions  if there are multiple arrays that satisfy the conditions print any  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤                         sample input                                                        sample output                                   explanation test case following are the subarrays of length ≥≥  lengthlength sumsum sumsum lengthlength sumsum   we can see that for each of these subarrays the sum is not divisible by the length  test case following are the subarrays of length ≥≥  lengthlength sumsum sumsum sumsum  lengthlength sumsum sumsum lengthlength sumsum  we can see that for each of these subarrays the sum is not divisible by the length   author ★jeevanjyot editorial  codechef comproblemssegdiv tags                                   array cookoff cook jeevanjyot                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
