 chef is given a binary string aa of length nn  he can perform the following operation on aa any number of times  choose ll and rr ≤l≤r≤n≤l≤r≤n such that in the substring alralr the number of s is equal to the number of s and reverse the substring alralr   find the lexicographically smallest string that chef can obtain after performing the above operation any possibly zero number of times on aa  string xx is lexicographically smaller than string yy if either of the following satisfies  xx is a prefix of yy and x≠yx≠y  there exists an index ii such that xiyixiyi and xjyj∀jxjyj∀j such that ≤ji≤ji   input format  first line will contain tt the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  each test case contains two lines  the first line contains the integer nn the length of the binary string  the second line contains the binary string aa   output format for each test case print the lexicographically smallest binary string that can be obtained after performing the operation any possibly zero number of times  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅                          sample input                                                          sample output                              explanation test case  chef can choose ll and rr  the chosen substring aa  on reversing this we get   thus the final string is aa   note that this is the lexicographically smallest string possible  test case  since the string is already lexicographically minimum chef does not need to apply any operation   author ★saritesh tester ★aryanc editorial  codechef comproblemsbalrev tags                                   cakewalk saritesh sorting start strings                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
