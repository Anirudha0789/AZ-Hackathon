 chef has decided to move on in life and forget his last girlfriend  he has decided to get rid of all the love letters which he had received from his girlfriend by burning them  but he can burn the letters only when he is alone at home xa  chef has a total of n love letters which he had received from his girlfriend and he is alone at home for s hours  each love letter depending on the length and paper it is made up of takes time b minutes to burn  even though chef is sad but he’s concerned about the environment too  therefore he want’s to burn the minimum possible letters so as to last for s hours  if the love letters burn for exact s hours then print the number of love letters which are burned if the letters burn for less than s hours then print the total number of minutes for which the letters burnwhich happens in case chef runs out of letters  however if the letters burn for more than s hours then print the minimum number of letters burned and the minimum time in minutes for which the fire burns for after s hours  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two space separated integers n and s where n is the number of letters chef has in total and s is the time in hours for which the fire should burn  n lines lines follow which each contain an integer b which is the time taken in minutes by that letter to burn  output for each test case print the minimum number of letters required to be burned at least for time s  if it burns for more than s also print the minimum difference between s and the time for which they burn  if it burns for less than s then print the time for which it burns  if it burns for time s then only print the no  of letters to be burned   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ s ≤   ≤ b ≤   example input               output     explanation example case    hours is equal to  minutes     but         therefore minimum no  of letters required is  to burn for at least  hours  since it burns for time  minutes so the difference between s and time is    notethe letters are burned one after the other  when one letter finishes burning the next will be burned without any delay   author akashdeepuiet editorial  codechef comproblemscoex tags                                   akashdeepuiet greedy knapsack medium                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
