 you have r red g green and b blue balloons  to decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons  three balloons attached to some table shouldnt have the same color  what maximum number n of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color your task is to write a program that for given values r g and b will find the maximum number n of tables that can be decorated in the required manner  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains  space separated integers r g and b — the number of red green and blue baloons respectively  output for each test case output a single integer n — the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ r ≤   ≤ g ≤   ≤ b ≤   example input           output     explanation example case   you can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets rgg gbb brr rrg where r g and b represent the red green and blue balls respectively   author ★puneetguptaa editorial  codechef comproblemscdx tags                                   easy greedy puneetguptaa                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
