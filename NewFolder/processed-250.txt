 initially alice and bob both have a bag of nn stones each with every stone having a lowercase alphabet written on it  both players know the stones of the other player  alice and bob want to create a string ss of length ⋅n⋅n using the stones they have  they play a game to create the string  the rules of the game are as follows  initially all the indices of ss are empty  alice starts the game  the players take alternating turns  in each turn the player can choose one of the stones from their bag and place it at any empty index ii ≤i≤⋅n≤i≤⋅n of ss   the game ends when both the players have used all their stones     alice wants ss to be as lexicographically small as possible while bob wants ss to be as lexicographically large as possible   find the final string ss formed by characters written on stones if both alice and bob play optimally   note a string xx is lexicographically smaller than a string yy if and only if one of the following holds  xx is a prefix of yy and x≠yx≠y in the first position where xx and yy differ the string xx has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in yy   input format  the first line contains an integer tt  the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows the first line of each test case contains an integer nn  the number of stones each player has  the second line of each test case contains a string aa of length nn describing the stones in alices bag initially  the third line of each test case contains a string bb of length nn describing the stones in bobs bag initially   output format for each test case print the final string ss formed if alice and bob play optimally  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤  ≤n≤≤n≤ it is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅                          sample input                              aza abz  cccc cccc                          sample output                            azabza cccccccc explanation test case initially alices stones are aza  while bobs stones are abz  initially ss is            alices turn alice puts stone a at index ii  string ss a      alices stones za bobs stones abz    bobs turn bob puts stone z at index ii  string ss a z     alices stones za bobs stones ab    alices turn alice puts stone a at index ii  string ss a z a    alices stones z bobs stones ab    bobs turn bob puts stone a at index ii  string ss a z a   a alices stones z bobs stones b    alices turn alice puts stone z at index ii  string ss a z a  z a alices stones  bobs stones b    bobs turn bob puts stone b at index ii  string ss a z a b z a alices stones  bobs stones    since both the players have used all their stones the game ends  so the final string ss is azabza      author ★hardik editorial  codechef comproblemsstngame tags                                   easymedium greedy hardik start                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
