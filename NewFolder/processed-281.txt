 read problem statements in mandarin chinese and bengali  there are nn positions in a queue  given a binary string ss of length nn where sisi  denotes there is a person standing in the ithith position  the distance between two people standing in the ithith and jthjth positions respectively in the queue is ∣i−j∣∣i−j∣ where ∣x∣∣x∣ denotes the absolute value of xx  now two people are considered to be friends if they are at a distance less than or equal to kk   lets say there are mm people pp…pmpp…pm standing one after another in a queue such that for each ≤im≤im pipi and pipi are friends then all the mm people are considered to be in a friend group  for example consider the string ss  and kk   lets denote the people standing in the stst ndnd thth and thth positions in the queue by pppppppp respectively  now pp and pp are friends as the distance between them is  pp and pp are also friends as the distance between them is   pp is not friend with anyone  hence pppppp form a friend group and pp forms a separate friend group  now each person can move one position right or one position left or stay in the same position  however they cant move out of the queue  find the minimum number of friend groups they can form if they move optimally  it is possible that there is more than one person standing in the same position after the movements  input format  the first line of input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two integers nknk  the second line of each test case contains a string ss   output format for each test case print a single line containing one integer  the minimum number of friend groups  constraints  ≤t≤⋅≤t≤⋅ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤n≤k≤n ss contains only characters  and  the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed                           sample input                                                               sample output                               explanation  test case  if the person standing in the thth position moves one position left the distance between the two people becomes  which is equal to kk  so they form a friend group  test case  if the person standing in the stst position moves one position right and the person standing in the thth position moves one position left the string becomes  still the distance between them is greater than kk  so they form two separate friend groups  test case  initially first three people form a friend group and the fourth person forms a separate friend group  now if the fourth person moves one position left he becomes a friend of the third person as the distance between these two people is equal to  and hence all the four people belong to one friend group    author ★soumyadeep editorial  codechef comproblemsfriendgr tags                                   string dynamic programming greedy                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
