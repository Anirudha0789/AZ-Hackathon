 read problem statements in mandarin bengali and russian as well  chef is a wanted criminal and nn police officers are up for catching him  the officers want to catch chef no matter the cost and chef also wants to eliminate as many officers as possible preferably everyone before getting caught or before running away after eliminating everyone  neither the officers nor chef will run away before accomplishing their goals  chef and the officers are on a onedimensional grid with coordinates ranging from −− to   chef is initially standing at coordinate cc and the iith officer is initially at coordinate pipi  the officers and chef then take turns to move with the officer team moving first   during their turn officers will have to move to an adjacent unoccupied cell one by one in any order they want  every officer will have to move  at every moment of time no two officers can be in the same cell and also no officer can be in the same cell as chef  if the officer is unable to move to an adjacent unoccupied cell he is eliminated and the cell he was in becomes unoccupied  note that the officer team will try to move to eliminate as few officers as possible  for example with pp and cc then the next positions of the officers can be    or   however with pp and cc the only possible set of the next positions of the officers is   after the officer teams turn chef also moves to an adjacent unoccupied cell or gets caught if he cannot find any adjacent unoccupied cell  the process then repeats until either chef is caught or all officers are eliminated and chef runs away  you need to find out the maximum number of officers that can be eliminated by chef and if chef can run away or not  as a reminder two cells with coordinates xx and yy are adjacent if and only if x−yx−y  input format  the first line contains tt  the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the number of officers  the second line of each test case contains a single integer cc  the initial coordinate of chef  the third line of each test case contains nn integers pp…pnpp…pn  the initial coordinates of the officers   output format for each test case output on a single line two spaceseparated integers the first integer is the maximum number of officers that can be eliminated by chef and the second integer is  if chef runs away or −− if chef will be caught  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤c≤≤c≤ ≤pi≤≤pi≤ all the coordinates are unique  that means pi≠cpi≠c for all ≤i≤n≤i≤n and pi≠pjpi≠pj for all ≤ij≤n≤ij≤n                         sample input                                                             sample output                                explanation  test case  chef chooses to always move to the left i e  to the smaller coordinate this forces the officer at coordinate  to always move to the left and eventually being cornered and eliminated  however the officer at coordinate  cannot be eliminated and hence chef will be caught at the end  test case  similarly chef chooses to always move to the left and eventually eliminating the only officer thus running away at the end    author ★ashishhanny editorial  codechef comproblemschefup tags                                   loops basic maths adhoc sorting observation                                                              basic programming concepts mathematics algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
