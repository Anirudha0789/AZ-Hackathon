 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and bengali as well  chef gives you an array aa of length nn consisting of integers  he asks you to choose a subarray with at least  elements of the given array  following out of your chosen subarray chef will pick out any two elements   your net score would be the sum of the remaining elements of the subarray  obviously chef adopts a strategy to minimize your score  find the maximum score you can have  input format  the first line of input contains tt denoting the number of test cases  each test case is as follows   the first line contains nn denoting the size of the array    the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers denoting the contents of the array aa   output format for each test case output a single integer denoting your maximum score  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ −≤ai≤−≤ai≤ the sum of nn over all test cases doesnt exceed ⋅⋅                         sample input                                                                                       sample output                                 explanation test case  you choose subarray  and chef chooses elements  and   so your net score is   test case  you choose subarray  and chef chooses elements  and   so your net score is   test case  you choose subarray  and chef chooses elements  and   so your net score is   test case  you can only choose the subarray  and chef chooses elements  and   so your net score is  as no elements remain in your chosen subarray   author ★watchhrs editorial  codechef comproblemscc tags                                   monotonic stack segment trees binary search                                                              data structures stacks advanced data structures advanced tree structures algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
