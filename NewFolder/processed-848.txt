 xa mr  swegwan likes to play around with arrays  recently while sitting in his room he invented a new game to play with arrays  in this game firstly you are given an array a of size n by mr  swegwan and each element of the array lies in the range lrinclusive  you have to choose exactly one integer from the array and replace it with another integer that also lies in the range lr inclusive  you necessarily have to change a number and you cant change a number with itself  after the replacement you are required to sort the array  now mr  swegwan wants to know what would be the minimum integer that could occur at each position after the replacement and sorting  xa input first line of input contains t the number of test cases  in the description of each test case the first line contains three space seperated integers nlr  the second line for each test case contains n space separated integers the array elements  xa output for each test case output in a new line n integers each showing the minimum element at the index on which it is being printed if the answer exists and  otherwise  xa constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ l ≤ r ≤  l ≤ ai ≤ r  xa example input                   output           xa  author ★daga editorial  codechef comproblemsswegarr tags                                   adhoc cobl daga easy sorting swegwan                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
