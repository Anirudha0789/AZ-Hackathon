  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef has a collection of n postage stamps  each stamp belongs to some type which are enumerated as positive integers  more valuable stamps have a higher enumerated type  so type  is the least valuable type of stamps type  is a bit more valuable and so on  chef often communicates with other philatelists via a stamp exchange website called pbay  on any particular day pbay lists several offers each of which is represented as an unordered pair a b allowing its users to exchange stamps of type a with an equal number of stamps of type b  chef can use such an offer to put up any number of stamps of enumerated type a on the website and get the same number of stamps of type b in return or viceversa of course he must have enough stamps of the corresponding type  assume that any number of stamps chef wants are always available on the sites exchange market  each offer is open during only one day chef cant use it after this day but he can use it several times during this day  if there are some offers which are active during a given day chef can use them in any order  chef is interested in making his collection as valuable as possible  help him to find maximum possible value of his collection after going through accepting or declining all the offers  value of chefs collection is equal to the sum of type enumerations of all stamps in the collection  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the  description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two integers n and m denoting number of stamps in chefs collection and number of offers respectively  next line contains n integers denoting the enumerated types of stamps in chefs collection  the ith of the following m lines contains three integers — ti ai and bi — denoting that on day ti there is an offer about exchanging stamps of types ai and bi  output for each test case output a single line containing maximum possible value of chefs collection after all offers  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ m ≤  types are enumerated with integers from  to   ≤ ti ≤   subtasks subtask   points   ≤ m ≤  types are enumerated with integers from  to   ≤ ti ≤     subtask   points  original constraints                         sample input                                                                       sample output                             explanation example case   chef can use nd offer to exchange the stamp of type  with an stamp of type   after that he can use st offer to exchange his  stamps of type  with  stamps of type   finally on rd day chef uses the offer to exchange the stamp of type  with an stamp of type   after this transaction value of his collection becomes          author ★eartemov tester ★iscsi editorial  codechef comproblemschstamp tags                                   graphs maps hashmaps connected components dfs bfs                                                              data structures advanced algorithms advanced graph algos algorithms graph algos traversals                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
