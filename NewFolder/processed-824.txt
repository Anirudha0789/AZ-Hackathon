  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you like tracking airplane flights a lot  specifically you maintain history of an airplane’s flight at several instants and record them in your notebook  today you have recorded n such records h h     hn denoting the heights of some airplane at several instants  these records mean that airplane was first flying on height h then started changing its height to h then from h to h and so on  the airplanes are usually on cruise control while descending or ascending so  you can assume that plane will smoothly increasedecrease its height from hi to hi   with a constant speed  you can see that during this period the airplane will cover all possible heights in the range minhi hi maxhi hi both inclusive  it is easy to see that the plane will be at all possible heights in the range exactly a single instant of time during this ascenddescend   you are interested in finding the maximum integer k such that the plane was at some height exactly k times during the flight  input there is a single test case  first line of the input contains an integer n denoting the number of records of heights of the plane  second line contains n space separated integers denoting h h     hn  output output a single maximum integer k in one line such that the plane was at some height exactly k times during the flight   constraints  hi ≠ hi  subtasks  subtask   points   ≤ n ≤   ≤ hi ≤   subtask   points   ≤ n ≤   ≤ hi ≤                           sample input                                                           sample output                             explanation  the flight can be draw as        there are infinitely many heights at which the plane was  times during the flight for example      notice that the plane was only  times at height   moreover there are no height at which the plane was more than  times so the answer is     author ★pkacprzak tags                                   frequency arrays maps segment trees lazy propagation sweep line algorithm sorting range queries                                                              data structures arrays advanced data structures advanced tree structures advanced algorithms computational geometry algorithms queries                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
