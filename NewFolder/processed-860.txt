 xa arush was not always poor at mathematics but his recent performances had not been that good and he had lost his confidence  now his elder brother was determined to bring back his confidence back in mathematics   so he made a tricky question and made sure that arush would be able to do solve it  the factorial of a nonnegative integer n denoted by n  is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n  n  n  n  n            arush’s elder brother so defined a function fx for positive integer x as the product of factorials of its constituting digits  for example f        you are given a number n that contains d digits and contains at least one digit larger than    the problem is to find maximum positive number m which should contain neither the digit  nor the digit  and also fm  fn  the number n may possibly start with leading zeroes  help arush to bring his confidence back  xa input  the first line of input contains t the number of testcases  the first line contains an integer d number of digits in n  next line contains d digits of n   xa output  output the maximum possible integer m that satisfies the above conditions   xa constraints should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have  format it like   ≤ t ≤   ≤ d ≤   xa example input       output    xa explanation example case   d   n    now f     and f             author ★rjohari editorial  codechef comproblemsclco tags                                   clco easymedium externalcontest greedy maths rjohari sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
