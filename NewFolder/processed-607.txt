 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  there are n special points on the d plane  you can travel from a special point xi yi to another special point xj yj if and only if xi  xj  yi  yj ≥ d  you need to find the largest integer d such that we can start at some special point and visit each of the other special points directly or through other special points  note that you can visit a special point more than once  input  the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of each testcase follows  the first line of each testcase contains a single integer n which denotes the number of special points  the ith of the next n lines contains two integers xi and yi which denotes that xi yi is a special point   output for each test case output a single line containing the answer  subtasks subtask   points   ≤ n ≤    ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤   subtask   points   ≤ n ≤     ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤     subtask   points  original constraints  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤  ≤ xi yi ≤   ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤                          sample input                                                                   sample output                             explanation we can start at some point and travel to all of the points if d   but not if d is greater than   hence the answer is   let us take an example when d is   you can start at   and move to   because             from   you can move back to   and then to    from there you can go to   and then to    you then go to   and then to    hence we have visited all the special points   author ★arpa editorial  codechef comproblemstravelal tags                                   deque bfs sorting binary search manhattan distance                                                              data structures queues algorithms graph algos traversals searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
