  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  chef has n simple polygons non self intersecting polygons in which no two of them intersect with each other  for any two polygons p p either p lies inside p or vice versa   chef wants you to count number of polygons lying strictly inside each of the polygons  input first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of polygons  the description of n polygons is as follows  the first line contains an integer mi denoting the number of vertices in the ith polygon the second line contains mi pairs of integers xi j yi j representing coordinates of vertices of ith  polygon in clockwise or counterclockwise order output for each test case output a single line containing n spaceseparated integers such that ith of them represents number of polygons lying inside the ith polygon  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ mi ≤  the sum of mi or total amount of given points over all test cases in one test file does not exceed  absolute value of each coordinate doesnt exceed  subtask   points  t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ mi ≤  absolute value of each coordinate doesnt exceed     subtask   points  all polygons are  convex polygons      subtask   points  original constraints                             sample input                                                                                    sample output                               explanation  in the picture the first polygon is marked in green second  in red and third in blue color      author ★antoniuk editorial  codechef comproblemschplgns tags                                   antoniuk cakewalk geometry june sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
