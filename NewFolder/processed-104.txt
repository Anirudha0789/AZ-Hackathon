 most problems on codechef highlight chefs love for food and cooking but little is known about his love for racing sports  he is an avid formula  fan  he went to watch this years indian grand prix at new delhi  he noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road  it was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment  therefore a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it  while watching the race chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed  formally youre given the maximum speed of n cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit  each car prefers to move at its maximum speed  if thats not possible because of the front car being slow it might have to lower its speed  it still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions  for the purpose of this problem you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long  count the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment  input the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases to follow  description of each test case contains  lines  the first of these lines contain a single integer n the number of cars  the second line contains n space separated integers denoting the maximum speed of the cars in the order they entered the long straight segment  output for each test case output a single line containing the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the segment  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤  all speeds are distinct positive integers that fit in a  bit signed integer  each input file will not be larger than  mb  bytes in size   warning the input files are very large  use faster io                           sample input                                                                  sample output                               explanation test case  there is only  car  thus it can move at its maximum speed  test case  the first car moves at speed   the second car can move at speed  without colliding with the first car  for the third car if it moves at speed  it would collide with the second car after some finite amount of time  the maximum speed at which the third car can move avoiding any collision is   thus  cars can move at their maximum speed  test case  following are the maximum speeds of all the cars   the first car moves at a maximum speed of   the maximum speed at which the second car can move without colliding is   the third car can move at its maximum speed which is   the maximum speed at which the fourth car can move without colliding is   the maximum speed at which the fifth car can move without colliding is    thus two cars can move at their maximum speed  these cars are car  and    author ★nikhiladm tester ★gamabunta editorial  codechef comproblemscarvans tags                                   d arrays adhoc                                                              data structures arrays algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
