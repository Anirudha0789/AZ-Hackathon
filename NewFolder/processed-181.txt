 chef has an array aa containing nn integers  the integers of the array can be positive negative or even zero  chef allows you to choose at most kk elements of the array and multiply them by −−  find the maximum sum of a subsequence you can obtain if you choose the elements of the subsequence optimally   note a sequence aa is a subsequence of a sequence bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several possibly zero or all elements  for example  is a subsequence of  and  but not a subsequence of  and   note that empty sequence is also a subsequence   input format  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nknk  the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers aa   anaa   an  output format for each test case print a single line containing one integer  the maximum sum of a subsequence you can obtain  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤n≤k≤n −≤ai≤−≤ai≤ sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed                          sample input                                                                          sample output                               explanation test case  it is optimal to multiply −−−− with −− and then take the subsequence   test case  it is optimal to choose empty subsequence with a sum equal to   test case  we can take subsequence   here we do not multiply −− with any element   author utkarshadm editorial  codechef comproblemssignflip tags                                   subsequence                                                              data structures arrays groupings                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
