 read problems statements in mandarin chinese  russian and vietnamese as well  tumut the best programmer in his village applidz invented a problem and decided to share it with you you are given two integer sequences ss…snss…sn and tt…tmtt…tm and an integer xx  you are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times  choose an element of ss and an element of tt lets denote them by sisi and tjtj respectively decrease both sisi and tjtj by xx i e  replace sisi by si−xsi−x and tjtj by tj−xtj−x  lets denote the minimum and maximum value in the sequence ss after performing the chosen operations possibly none by minsmins and maxsmaxs respectively  similarly lets denote the minimum and maximum value in tt after performing the chosen operations by mintmint and maxtmaxt respectively  the goal is minimizing the expression maxsmaxt−minsmintmaxsmaxt−minsmint  compute the minimum value of this expression   input  the first line of the input contains three spaceseparated integers nn mm and xx  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers ss…snss…sn  the third line contains mm spaceseparated integers tt…tmtt…tm   output print a single line containing one integer — the minimum possible value of the expression maxsmaxt−minsmintmaxsmaxt−minsmint  constraints  ≤nm≤⋅≤nm≤⋅ ≤si≤≤si≤ for each valid ii ≤ti≤≤ti≤ for each valid ii ≤x≤≤x≤  subtasks subtask   points  nm≤nm≤ si≤si≤ for each valid ii ti≤ti≤ for each valid ii  subtask   points  nm≤nm≤ si≤si≤ for each valid ii ti≤ti≤ for each valid ii  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                            sample output                             explanation we can perform these two operations  decrease ss and tt by xx decrease ss and tt by xx  afterwards the sequence ss will be  and the sequence tt will be −−  the resulting value of the given expression is −−−−  it is impossible to obtain a smaller value no matter how many operations are performed   author ★allllekssssa editorial  codechef comproblemsxtgr tags                                   number theory greedy observation                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
