 xa chef studied science at school  but now he was tired of it  he likes to solve problems on codechef  here and now he decided to go to his favourite site and solve several interesting problems  but as it turned out chef is not yet ready to solve the harder problems  so you have to help him   if you take away all the foreword then the task set is this you have n nonnegative numbers a a     an and m requests  each request consists of three numbers l v k  magicintegerlv is equal to concatenation of the numbers ai such that i  l  v  q    i  n  q    for each such request you have to write the kth digit of magicintegerlv  concatanation example if you have  numbers    after concatenation you will have   if you have  number     after concatenation you will have   one more example      after concatenation you will have   first digit of this string is  not    xa input the first line contains an integer n denoting the number of integers in the given array  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an denoting the given array  the third line has a single integer m denoting the number of requests  the next m lines contains three space separated numbers in each line l v k denoting each request   output for each request output a single line containing kth digit of magicintegerl v  if the length of magicintegerlv is smaller than k you need to output so sad without quotes  constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ m ≤   ≤ ai ≤   ≤ l v ≤   ≤ k ≤   xa example input                       output    so sad  xa scoring subtask   points n ≤  subtask   points v ≤  subtask   points  look at constraints   author furkoadm editorial  codechef comproblemschithh tags                                   dynamic programming binary search                                                              algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
