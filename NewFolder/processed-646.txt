 in a game there are mm boxes each containing ajaj grams of gold  in a turn nn chains are kept on the ground with lili and riri denoting the coordinates of the left and right end of the ithith chain  you are allowed to lock at most one box of gold in each turn  to lock a box containing ajaj grams of gold you need a chain of thickness pp and length at least ajaj  to get a thickness of pp you need to join pp chains in place you cannot drag the chains in any direction and remove the extra part of the chains which are not helping in forming thickness pp  the length of the resultant continuous is the length of the joined chain of thickness pp  you win the gold present in your lockedlocked box  given tt turns with different settings of chains find the maximum amount of gold you can win in each turn   all the turns are independent i e  if a box was locked in the previous turn it is unlocked before the next turn  input  first line of the input contains a single integer mm describing the number of boxes  second line of the input contains mm space separated integers denoting aa… amaa… am  third line of the input contains a single integer tt describing the number of turns  the description of tt turns follows first line of each turn contains two space separated integers nn and pp  this is followed by nn lines  for each ii ≤i≤n≤i≤n the ithith of these lines contains two space separated integers lili and riri   output for each of the turn print the weight of gold won in grams  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤p≤n≤≤p≤n≤ ≤li≤ri≤≤li≤ri≤ ≤aj≤≤aj≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ∗∗  sample input                             sample output     author ★kishen editorial  codechef comproblemsgrush tags                                   binarysearch cnxh easymedium heap kishen                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
