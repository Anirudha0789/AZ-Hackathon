 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  yesterday chef found kk empty boxes in the cooler and decided to fill them with apples  he ordered nn apples where nn is a multiple of kk  now he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion   only two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job  in one minute each candidate can put kk apples into boxes but they do it in different ways the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts kk apples in it  chef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires  can you answer that question note the boxes are distinguishable labeled while the apples are not  therefore two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first and only line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and kk    output for each test case print a single line containing the string yes if the final distributions of apples can be different or no if they will be the same without quotes  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nk≤≤nk≤ nn is divisible by kk  subtasks subtask   points ≤nk≤≤nk≤ subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                            sample output                            no no yes explanation example case  no matter who is hired all apples will be in the only box at the end  example case  at the end there will be two apples in each box  example case  if we hire the first candidate there will be one apple in each box but if we hire the second one there will be  apples in one box and none in all other boxes   author ★yy editorial  codechef comproblemsdstapls tags                                   basic maths observation                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
