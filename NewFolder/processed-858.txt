 you are given two sets of points ss and tt on the xyxyplane  ss contains nn points and tt contains  mm points  the points xiyixiyi in tt have a special property  for every ≤im≤im xixixixi and yiyiyiyi  for each point xy∈txy∈t find the minimum manhattan distance between xyxy and a point in ss  formally for each xy∈txy∈t find minxiyi∈sx−xiy−yiminxiyi∈sx−xiy−yi input format  the first line of input contains two spaceseparated integers nn and mm  the size of ss and tt respectively  the next nn lines each contain two spaceseparated integers xixi and yiyi representing the points of ss  the last mm lines each contain two spaceseparated integers xixi and yiyi representing the points of tt   output format  for each test case output mm lines  the iith of these lines should contain a single integer the minimum manhattan distance between the iith point in tt and a point in set ss   constraints  ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ −≤xiyi≤−≤xiyi≤  subtasks subtask  points original constraints                          sample input                                                               sample output                              explanation the sets are ss and tt  every point in ss is at a manhattan distance of  from every point in tt                           sample input                                                                   sample output                               explanation the sets are ss and tt    the point closest to  is  with distance  the point  in ss coincides with the point  in set tt  the point closest to  is  with distance  the points in red are the points of the set ss and those in blue belong to set tt  the greencoloured line segments represent the manhattan distance between two points    author ★jayeshaw editorial  codechef comproblemsminmanh tags                                   case work computational geometry                                                              special advanced algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
