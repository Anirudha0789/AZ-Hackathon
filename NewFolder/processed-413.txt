 xa fluffy was the judge of another programming contest  this time there are n participants and k problems  each contestant makes exactly one submission for every problem  each participant has his own id which is numbered from  to n  initially the ranklist consists of the n participants and the scores of each participant are   the contestant with the highest score will be placed on top of the ranklist and so on  if there are ties the one with the higher id goes first   every time a contestant makes a submission it is possible for his rank to change  every time this happens fluffy will clap his hands and shout in excitement  now you know the scores of each participants submissions but you dont know when they submitted their solutions  however it is known that each participant submits his solutions in order which means he will submit his solution to problem i before submitting his solution to problem i   for all i  you have to figure out the maximum possible number of times that fluffy will clap his hands if you can pick when a contestant makes his submissions  note that all contestants must submit at different times   note that even if some contestant was in last place and after his submission he is in first place fluffy will only clap once and not once for every person he overtakes  xa input the first line contains two spaceseperated integers n and k the number of participants and the number of problems in the contest  the next n lines contain k spaceseperated integers where the jth integer of the ith line denotes the score of the submission of the ith contestant to the j problem  xa output output a single integer the maximum number of times fluffy could clap his hands  xa constraints   ≤ n k ≤   ≤ score of submission ≤   subtasks  subtask   points   ≤ n k ≤  subtask   points  original constraints  xa example input          output   xa explanation example case  initially contestant  is on top of the ranklist and contestant  is at the bottom  one of the possible ways to get fluffy to clap  times is to let contestant  submit his first two solutions and let contestant  submit his solution to problem  which makes his rank change from  to   next let contestant  submit his solution to problem  which makes his rank change from  to   note that they are tied but contestant  wins because he has higher id finally let contestant  submit the rest of his solutions  he will overtake contestant  once and makes fluffy clap once more  the total number of times fluffy clapped is  which is the maximum possible   author ★zscoder editorial  codechef comproblemsmco tags                                   easy greedy mco zscoder                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java cpp pyth pyp  submit
