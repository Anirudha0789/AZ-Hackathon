 xa  under the swaccha bharat abhiyan afzal decides to clean a park covered with garbage and leaves with a battery operated vacuum cleaner  the park is a  dimensional space with roads occupying some of its squares such as the one shown in the figure below  the naming conventions are cartesian with the origin square being named as   afzal needs to clean the park with the following constraints   he has t minutes of time in which he can clean as much as possible  he has a vacuum cleaner which is fully charged with c units  there is only one charging point in the park which is at this starting square say xy  cleaning each square consumes  units of charge and  minutes of time  moving from one square to its adjacent requires no units of charge and  minutes of time  if the charge left in the vacuum cleaner is less than  the square cannot be cleaned  in this case he will have to back to his starting point for charging and the time required for charging is  minutes  afzal can move his cleaner only on the roads of the park   you need to find out the maximum number of squares that can be cleaned in this time interval   xa input  the first line of input will contain a single integer n denoting number of squares filled by the roads  the second line will contain the integer t denoting total available time  the third line will contain the integer c denoting the total charge  the fourth line will contain the coordinates of the start square in the form i j which refers to the ijth square  the next n lines will contain the coordinates of the squares in the form i j which refers to the ijth square   output  output will contain a single integer denoting the number of squares cleaned   constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ c ≤  maximum area of the park will be  x    xa example input                                                                            output   xa explanation example case   the example is same as the image shown above  at t he is at   at t he cleans  rem  charge is   at t he is at   at t he cleans  rem  charge is   at t he is again at  to charge  at t he completes charging  at t he is at   at t he cleans  rem  charge is   at t he cleans  rem  charge is   at t he is at the starting pt   for charging  at t charging gets complete  however only  minutes are remaining and no square can be cleaned now hence the output      author abhirajphadnis editorial  codechef comproblemstrindia tags                                   abhirajphadnis graphs greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
