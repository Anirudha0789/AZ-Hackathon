 xa ramanujan loves to play with numbers  he once asked everyone in his class a question  “given a number n what is the smallest number which can be formed whose product of digits will be equal to n  for example if n is  the number is  ”  his friend pointed out to him that there are certain numbers which cannot be formed in this manner  ramanujan took due note of that and told everyone in his class to try solving this problem through programming  your task is to print the smallest number whose product of digits is equal to n  if there is no such number you must print    xa input the first line of input will contain an integer t denoting the number of test cases                                 each of the next t lines  each  will have a positive whole number n  output for each test case print on a new line the smallest number whose product of digits is n  if there is no such number print   constraints   ≤ n ≤   points  ≤ n ≤   points   xa example input                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    output  xa explanation in the first case the smallest number whose product of digits is  is  as   for the second case there are no numbers in which the product of digits will give us the original number  so we print   for the third case  can be represented as  hence number is     the input and output format must be strictly followed    author ★animeshf editorial  codechef comproblemscdqu tags                                   animeshf cdqu easy factorization greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
