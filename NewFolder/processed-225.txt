  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef has an array a of  x n integers  he wants to make as many disjoint triples as possible a triple is a set of three integers from this array such that sum of elements in each triple is equal  two triples aa ab ac and ax ay az are considered disjoint iff the sets a b c and x y z are disjoint  please help chef achieve this task  input the first line of each test file contains a single integer n indicating that the number of elements in the array a is  x n  the second line contains  × n spaceseparated integers a a …  a x n   output  output two lines as described below   the first line should contain one integer k denoting the number of triples you found  in the second line you should print k triples of integers — indices of numbers in each triple  scoring your score for each test case will be the number of triples you found  your goal is to maximise this score  your total score for the problem will be the sum of scores on all the test cases  your solution will be tested only on  of the test files during the contest and will be rejudged against  after the end of competition  you will get wrong answer verdict if some element of the array is repeated in your output triples are not disjoint or if there are two triples with different sum of elements invalid triples  if you output only one triple thats ok youll get a score of   constraints  n    ≤ ai ≤   example input               output            explanation in this example we made three triples a a a     a a a     and a a a      as you can see                     so this output is correct because the sum of numbers in each triple is equal to the same number and there is no element of array that occurs more than once in triples  score for this testcase will be  because you found three triples  note that this test case cant be in the official test data because n doesnt equal   test data generation  there will be two types of test files   type  we manually choose numbers lo and hi  n will be equal   each element of an array will be randomly chosen from interval lo  hi   type  we manually choose the number s lo and hi  n will be equal   then we generate n random triples with sum of elements equal to s and each element from lo … hi  add all those elements to the array and shuffle it    there will be  test files of type  and  test files of type   in each test file we can manually change one element to prevent recognizing type of test file by sum of numbers in it  during the contest your solutions will be tested on two tests of the first type and two tests of the second type  also you can assume that  in  of test data hilo ≤    in  of test data hilo ≤    in  of test data hilo ≤    in  of test data hilo ≤      author ★antoniuk tester ★mgch editorial  codechef comproblemschmktrps tags                                   antoniuk challenge greedy jan                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
