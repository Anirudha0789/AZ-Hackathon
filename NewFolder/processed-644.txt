 jashan had been playing minecraft for a while  it is a game where everything is in the form of cubic blocks no curves  he thought of making a new mountainous terrain having his own rules in which the blocks are placed  the rules are  the mountain is in the form of an array of n×mn×m dimensions  each element of the array represents the height of the mountain at that point  the height of the mountain increases or remains the same along the row i e  nondecreasing  the first element of every row will have a greater or equal height than the previous rows greatest element   he went to make the terrain with his dog and started coming back down after completing it  unfortunately he slipped from the slope and fell down to the point where he started   his dog got detached from its collar and remained on the block he fell from  now he has to teleport to the block his dog is on to bring it back  the only way to reach his dog is to know the coordinates of that block  after the fall jashan vaguely remembers the qq heights he possibly fell down from but not the coordinates  help him find the coordinates of each of the qq heights  it is guaranteed that a block of the given height always exists  if there are multiple coordinates with the same height report the first coordinate that comes in the rowmajor order   input  the first line has an integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the first line of each test case has three integers nn mm qq  the next nn lines have mm spaceseparated integers representing the height hh of each point on the mountain  then qq lines follow which list out the possible heights  output for each test case output qq lines of spaceseparated integers which are the possible coordinates of the point on the mountain where the dog is present  if there are multiple coordinates with the same height report the first coordinate that comes in the rowmajor order   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nm≤≤nm≤ ≤q≤≤q≤ ≤h≤≤h≤ subtasks  subtask   points ≤q≤≤q≤ subtask   points original constraints sample input                           sample output             explanation for the first matrix block with height  is present at  on the mountain  similarly blocks with heights  and  are present at  and  respectively  for the second matrix block with height  is present at  on the mountain  similarly block with height  is present at   note that even though there are  occurrences of height  in second matrix only first occurring coordinate in rowmajor order as output will be considered valid   author pecchapter editorial  codechef comproblemsminecrft tags                                   binarysearch easy pecchapter                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
