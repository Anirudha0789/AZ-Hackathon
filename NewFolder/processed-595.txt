 mikahs is fond of mathematics and his favourite topic is sets  he boasts of his knowledge in this topic and ramu the mathematician is jealous of mikahs  to take him down ramu prepares a tough challenge for mikahs  he first describes a new quantity for numbers discovered by him  for a number x the product of prime divisors of x is defined as the niceness value of x by ramu   for eg  x        therefore niceness value of  is      now comes his question an array of size n is given and  integers k a and b are given  mikahs is asked to find the number of subsets of size atmost k whose niceness value is in the range a b where niceness value of a subset is equal to the sum of niceness values of its elements   note two subsets are different when they contain at least one pair of elements ai in first subset aj in second subset where i  j  for eg  for array     subsets a a and a a are different   xa input first line of the input contains n k a b which are length of array maximum size of subset required and the lower and upper bound of the range respectively  second line contains n space separated integers the array elements  output print the number of subsets of size at most k whose niceness value is in the range a b  constraints   ≤ n ≤   ≤ k ≤ n  ≤ a  b ≤  array elements are in the range    xa example input          output  xa explanation the  subsets are     niceness value    niceness value     niceness value         niceness value         niceness value      thus all subsets are of size atmost  and their niceness values are in the range     author ★amanmittal editorial  codechef comproblemsinsqc tags                                   amanmittal binarysearch insq meetinmiddle                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages java c cpp pyp  submit
