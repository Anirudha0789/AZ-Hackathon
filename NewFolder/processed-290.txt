 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef tobby is trying to run a code given to him by bhuvan for an experiment they want to include in the manuscript to be submitted to a conference  the deadline to submit the manuscript is within a couple of hours and chef tobby needs to finish the experiments before then  the code given by bhuvan is the following which runs given an array of n integers and another integer k  void recurse  array a int n   t n  size of array tdefine array b currently empty tconsider all n subsets of a t ttx  bitwise or of elements in the subsets ttadd x into b if it is not present yet t tif sizeof b     k t ttprintf“won” ttreturn t trecurse  b sizeof b     chef tobby tried to run an experiment with only one integer in the array with value  and k    to his horror he found out that the algorithm is resulting in an infinite loop  he is livid with the possibility that the algorithm can lead to infinite loops for certain cases  on closer inspection he determines that it might be possible to insert additional elements in the initial array to subvert the problem  since time is very less chef tobby would like to insert the minimum number of elements  chef tobby has to finish writing the paper so he asks his graduate student leamas to fix it  leamas has no idea how to fix the problem so he asks you for help  input section the first line contains t the number of test cases  each test case consists of  lines  the first line contains  integers n and k denoting the number of elements in the array and parameter mentioned in problem statement  next line contains n space separated integers denoting the elements of the array  output section output the minimum number of elements that need to be inserted so that inifinite loop can be avoided  input constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤   ≤ k ≤   ≤ ai ≤ k where ai denotes the ith element of the array                          sample input                                                          sample output                             explanation you can win the game by inserting the element  into the array                           sample input                                                               sample output                             explanation the initial array will result will terminate in the first step of algorithm only  thus there is no need to insert any new element   author ★likecs tester ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemslikecs tags                                   basic maths bitwise operation greedy                                                              mathematics bit manipulation algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
