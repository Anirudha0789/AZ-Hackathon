  read problems statements in mandarin chinese and russian as well  there is a party going on in a club situated in some city  n gangsters will attend that party  the ith gangster comes to the party at the beginning of si time and will leave the party at the end of ei  at any time unit the set of gangsters who are present in the party enjoy drinking together and become friends  after the party the law enforcement agency in the city is suspecting that there has been some conspiracy for sabotage in the city  so they feel that it is necessary to interrogate several gangsters  but they dont have time to interrogate all of them  they are suspecting that there are x gangsters involved in this conspiracy  it is natural that those x gangsters will be friends with each other now the enforcement agency have got the idea  they want to interrogate the gangsters in such a way that for each subset of x friend gangsters where each pair of gangsters in that subset are friends there will be at least one interrogated gangster from that subset  but to save their time they want to interrogate minimum number of gangsters  given the information of the gangsters and number x help them to find the minimum number of gangsters to be interrogated note two gangsters are friends if they have common time in the club  for example the gangster entering at time  and leaving at time  can be a friend with another gangster entering at time  and leaving some time afterwards  but a gangster leaving at time  cannot be a friend with another gangster entering at time   input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  each test case starts with a line containing n and x  each of the next n lines contains the arrival si and the departure ei of a gangster    output for each test case output a single line containing the minimum number of gangsters that the city law enforcement agency should interrogate    constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ x ≤ n ≤   ≤ si ≤ ei ≤   xa example input                              output     xa explanation example case   gangsters  and  are friends each other  also gangsters  and  are friends with each other  so it is enough to interrogate gangster  only  example case  all of the four gangsters are friends with each other  the police suspects that the size of the group is   so it is enough to interrogate any two of the gangsters  example case  there is not any group of  gangsters where each of them are friends with each other  so the police dont need to interrogate anybody    author satejadm editorial  codechef comproblemsgangaam tags                                   greedy observation                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
