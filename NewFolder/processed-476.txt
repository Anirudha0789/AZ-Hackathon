  read problems statements in russian here the head chef is studying the motivation and satisfaction level of his chefs   the motivation and satisfaction of a chef can be represented as an integer   the head chef wants to know the  n  th smallest sum of one satisfaction value and one motivation value for various values of  n    the satisfaction and motivation values may correspond to the same chef or different chefs   given two arrays the first array denoting the motivation value and the second array denoting the satisfaction value of the chefs   we can get a set of sumsadd one element from the first array and one from the second  for each query  denoted by an integer qi  i   to q   q denotes number of queries   find the qi th element in the set of sums  in nondecreasing order    input  the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a two space seperated integers k and   q  denoting the number of chefs and the number of queries    the second line of each test case contains k spaceseparated integers a a     ak denoting the motivation of chefs   the third line of each test case contains k spaceseparated integers b b     bk denoting the satisfaction of chefs    the next q lines contain a single integer qi  for i   to q   find the qi th element in the set of sums    output  for each query of each test case output a single line containing the answer to the query of the testcase   constraints should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have  format it like   ≤ t ≤   ≤ k ≤   ≤ q ≤   ≤ qi  for i   to q   ≤   ≤ ai ≤    for i   to k    ≤ bi  ≤   for i   to k     example input            output   explanation example case   there are  elements in the set of sums                                                          the fourth smallest element is     author vineetadm tester ★rubanenko editorial  codechef comproblemslowsum tags                                   priority queue optimization problems sorting                                                              data structures queues special algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
