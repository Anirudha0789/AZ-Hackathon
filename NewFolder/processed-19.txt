 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given an integer sequence aa with length nn  find the number of unordered pairs of elements such that the average of these two elements is also present in the sequence  formally find the number of pairs ijij such that ≤ij≤n≤ij≤n and there is an index kk ≤k≤n≤k≤n for which akaiajakaiaj holds  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid pairs ijij  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ai≤ai≤ for each valid ii  subtasks subtask   points ≤n≤≤n≤ subtask   points ≤n≤≤n≤                          sample input                                                                    sample output                               explanation example case  we can take kk for akak to be either  or  since akak either way  since the problem asks for unordered pairs  is the only possible valid pair the same as   hence the answer is   example case  we see that aa  no other valid pair exists   author ★anuj editorial  codechef comproblemsavgpr tags                                   frequency arrays basic maths                                                              data structures arrays mathematics                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
