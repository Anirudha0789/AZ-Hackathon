  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  chef wants to split a team of new chef into two teams to play a game  in order to make the split he first designates two team captains who take alternate turns selecting players for their teams  during each turn the captain selects a single player for his team  since each captain wants to make the strongest possible team he will always select the best available player  the players have strengths as integer number where higher strength indicate better players  after all the players have been selected the team strength is computed as the sum of the strengths of the players on that team  for example if strengths of  players are  and  then the first captain selects the player with strength  for his team the second captain gets the player with strength  the first gets the one with strength  the second the one with strength  and the last one strength  goes to the first team  the first team now has a total strength  and the second team has strength    now chef wants to find the absolute strength difference between the two teams  for the example above the answer is   but chef does not know exact strengths of each player  he knows some parameter a b c and d and a formula to find the strength of each player  the formula is  ts  d tsi  a  si  b  si  c mod  for i   to n    there are n players numbering  to n and si is the strength of player i   t  input  first line of the input contains an integer t number of test cases to follow  each test consist of single line containing five integers n a b c and d   output  for each test case you have to print a single line containing the absolute strength difference between the two teams   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ a b c d ≤                          sample input                                                                          sample output                                 author shipluadm editorial  codechef comproblemstmslt tags                                   sorting                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
