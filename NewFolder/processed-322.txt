  today is chota mouses birthday  he wants to celebrate it in a grand style  his brother mota chuha immediately contacted a nearby bakery for an online delivery of a cake  the cake is of rectangular shape with height h and width w  chota mouse has invited f of his friends to the party  so he wants to make f vertical cuts at distinct positions on the cake so that the cake will be divided into f   nonzero area parts f for his friends and one for himself  let us assume the cake is placed along the coordinate axis with its left end at x coordinate  and right end at w  please see the image in the examples for details  he will make cuts at positions pi such that pi is strictly greater than zero and strictly less than w  also note that all the positions for cutting are distinct  chota mouse is a nice guy  so he will be keeping the piece with the least area for himself and leave the other pieces for his friends to enjoy  chota mouse is weak in mathematics so can you please help him figure out the area of the piece he is going to have  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  first line of each test case contains three space separated integers f h w  second line of each test case contains f space separated integers ith of them denotes pi  output for each test case print a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ f ≤   ≤ h ≤  f   ≤ w ≤   ≤ pi ≤ w    sample input               output    explanation in the first example both the pieces have same area i e      in the second example there are two pieces  first piece has an area of  second has an area of   so the answer will be    in the third example there are three pieces  first piece has an area of  second  and third   so the answer will be     author admin tags                                   acmamr adhoc admin greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages java c cpp pyp  submit
