 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef has been researching ant colonies for many years and finally discovered all their secrets  an ant colony consists of nn distinct lines numbered  through nn that pass through a point oo which is the queens home  for each valid ii there are mimi ants on the iith line  for each valid ii and jj the jjth ant on the iith line initially has a nonzero coordinate xijxij with the following meaning  the distance of this ant from oo is xijxij  lets choose a direction along the iith line from oo  the exact way in which this direction is chosen does not matter here it only needs to be the same for all ants on the same line  if xijxij is positive this ant is at the distance xijxij from oo in the chosen direction  otherwise it is at this distance from oo in the opposite direction   in other words two ants jj and kk on a line ii are at the same side of oo if the signs of xijxij and xikxik are the same or on opposite sides if the signs are different  all ants move with the same constant speed  initially all of them are moving towards oo  whenever two or more ants meet possibly at oo all of these ants turn around and start moving in the opposite directions with the same speed  we call this a collision  even if an ant reaches oo without meeting an ant there it keeps moving in the same direction  an ant may change direction multiple times  help chef find the total number of collisions between ants  note that even if more than two ants meet it counts as only one collision  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  nn lines follow  for each valid ii the iith of these lines contains an integer mimi followed by a space and mimi spaceseparated integers xixi…ximixixi…ximi   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the number of collisions between ants  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ ≤mi≤⋅≤mi≤⋅ for each valid ii ≤xij≤≤xij≤ for each valid ijij xijxijxijxij for each valid ijij the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅ the sum of mm…mnmm…mn over all test cases does not exceed   subtasks subtask   points nn subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                            sample output                             explanation example case  first the ants on the first line collide at the coordinate −− and change directions  finally ant  on the first line collides with the only ant on the second line this happens at oo  no collisions happen afterwards   author ★arayi editorial  codechef comproblemsantschef tags                                   arayi easymedium greedy implementation jan observation                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
