 chef has  nn doggo dogs  lets number them  to nn  chef decided to build houses for each but he soon realizes that keeping so many dogs at one place may be messy  so he decided to divide them into several groups called doggo communities  let the total no  of groups be kk   in a community paths between pairs of houses can be made so that doggo can play with each other  but there cannot be a path between two houses of different communities for sure  chef wanted to make maximum no  of paths such that the total path is not greater then kk  let’s visualize this problem in an engineers way  the problem is to design a graph with max edge possible such that the total no  of edges should not be greater than the total no  of connected components  input format  first line of each test case file contain tt  denoting total number of test cases  ithith test case contain only one line with a single integer nn  denoting the number of dogsvertex  output format  for each test case print a line with a integer  denoting the maximum possible path possible   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤   subtasks  pointspoints ≤n≤≤n≤   sample input   sample output  explanation  houses can be made with  like this community         community        or            in both cases the maximum possible path is    author ★sherlock editorial  codechef comproblemsdoggo tags                                   binarysearch easy sherlock str                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
