 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef has a sequence a with length n and a line given by the equation yx  k · x  b  let us say that an element aj is reachable from another element ai if the point ai aj is lying above or on the line yx i e  if aj ≥  k · ai  b  consider an arbitrary subsequence of a lets denote it by b  subsequence b is called good if its elements can be reordered in such a way that for each valid i bi is reachable from bi  chef asked you to compute the maximum possible length of a good subsequence  can you help him input  the first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains three spaceseparated integers n k and b  the second line contains n spaceseparated integers a a     an   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the length of the longest good subsequence of a  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ k b ≤   ≤ ai ≤  for each valid i  ≤ sum of n over all test cases ≤                          sample input                                                              sample output                             explanation example case  we can choose the subsequence    and reorder it to get the sequence     in this sequence  is reachable from  because  ·        and  is reachable from  because  ·         hence    is a good subsequence there is no good subsequence of a with length  or more so the answer is    author ★mgch tester ★wwwwodddd editorial  codechef comproblemscarray tags                                   segment trees dynamic programming greedy sorting binary search                                                              advanced data structures advanced tree structures algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
