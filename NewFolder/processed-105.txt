 little elephant was fond of inventing new games  after a lot of research little elephant came to know that most of the animals in the forest were showing less interest to play the multiplayer games  little elephant had started to invent single player games and succeeded in inventing the new single player game named coin flip  in this game the player will use nn coins numbered from  to nn and all the coins will be facing in same direction either head or tail which will be decided by the player before starting of the game  the player needs to play nn rounds  in the kkth round the player will flip the face of the all coins whose number is less than or equal to kk  that is the face of coin ii will be reversed from head to tail or from tail to head for i≤ki≤k  elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing a particular face after playing nn rounds  elephant really becomes quite fond of this game coin flip so elephant plays gg times  please help the elephant to find out the answer  input  the first line of input contains an integer tt denoting the number of test cases  then tt  test cases follow  the first line of each test contains an integer gg denoting the number of games played by elephant  each of the following gg lines denotes a single game and contains  spaceseparated integers ii nn qq where ii denotes the initial state of the coins nn denotes the number of coins and rounds and qq which is either  or  as explained below   here ii means all coins are showing head in the start of the game and ii means all coins are showing tail in the start of the game  qq means elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing head in the end of the game and qq means elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing tail in the end of the game  output for each game output one integer denoting the total number of coins showing the particular face in the end of the game  constraints ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤g≤≤g≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤i≤≤i≤ ≤q≤≤q≤                          sample input                                                             sample output                              explanation in the st game in example ii so initial arrangement of coins are h h h h h and now elephant will play  rounds and coin faces will be changed as follows after the st round t h h h h after the nd round h t h h h after the rd round t h t h h after the th round h t h t h after the th round t h t h t finally q so we need to find the total number of coins showing head which is  in the nd game in example this is similar to the st game except elephant needs to find the total number of coins showing tail  so the answer is   please see the final state of the coins in the stst game  author khadadm tester ★laycurse editorial  codechef comproblemsconflip tags                                   case work brute force                                                              special algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
