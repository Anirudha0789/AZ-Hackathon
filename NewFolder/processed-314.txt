 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  there are n snakes in snakeland  each snake can be denoted by either a horizontal or a vertical segment in the d grid  the snakes want to hold a discussion over the benefits and limitations of capitalism  two snakes can share their ideas with each other if they have at least one cell in common with each other  you want the snakes to have a proper discussion i e  each snake should be able to share their ideas with every other snake  in one second you can move a snake horizontally or vertically by one unit  also you can move as many snakes simultaneously as you wish  find the minimum number of seconds required to make this discussion possible  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting number of test cases  the description of the t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains an integer n  each of the next n lines contains four space separated integers x y and x y denoting that the head of the snake is at x y and the tail is at x y  it is guaranteed that snake will be denoted by either a horizontal or vertical segment  output for each test case output a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ x y x y ≤   example input                                  output     explanation example   the snakes have a common cell at coordinates    so they will be able to talk to each other  there is no need to move them  example   move the horizontal snake i e      to the left by  unit  it will now be      now the first and second snakes will have at least one common cell and will be able to talk to each other   hence because you spent one second the answer is   example   in the first second move the first snake i e      to the right by  unit it will be      also simultaneously move the second snake     upwards by  unit  it will now be at      so after this one second each pair of snakes have at least one common cell with each other and can talk and have a proper discussion   author admin tester ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemssndiscus tags                                   basic maths greedy brute force                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
