 read problem statements in mandarin bengali and russian as well  you are handed a binary string ss but not in any ordinary form  instead of being directly given the value of ss you are given an array cc of size nn representing the compression representation of ss  this means ss first contains cc  characters then cc  characters then cc  characters and so on  for example the array cc corresponds with the binary string   you are allowed to modify ss by swapping elements of cc  more specifically you are allowed to swap cici and cjcj as long as cici and cjcj both encodes blocks of the same character  for example from cc you can swap cc and cc because both of them encode blocks of s turning cc to  and ss to   however you cannot swap cc and cc because cc encodes a block of s while cc encodes a block of s  perform the swapping operation in any way as many times as you want including zero times so that the final string ss has as many  subsequences as possible  as a reminder a subsequence of a string is a sequence that can be derived by deleting zero or more characters without changing the order of the remaining characters  you need to find any optimal final array cc for which the number of  subsequence will be the largest possible  input format  the first line contains tt  the number of test cases  then the test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  the size of the array cc  the second line of each test case contains nn integers cc…cncc…cn  the compression representation of ss   output format for each test case output two lines the first line contains nn integers representing the optimal array cc and the second line contains the maximum number of  subsequences  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ci≤≤ci≤                         sample input                                                           sample output                                 explanation  test case  cc which means ss corresponds to   the optimal list of operations is to only swap cc and cc resulting in cc and ss  which has  subsequences of     author ★prasant editorial  codechef comproblemszeroone tags                                   adhoc                                                              algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
