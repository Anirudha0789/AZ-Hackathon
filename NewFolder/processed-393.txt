 you are given an array aaa…anaaa…an containing distinct positive integers  let bb be a permutation of aa  define the value of bb to be ∑inbimodbi∑inbimodbi where bnbn is treated to be bb  find the maximum value across all permutations of aa  input format  the first line of input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  each test case consists of two lines of input  the first line of each test case contains an integer nn — the size of aa  the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers — the elements of aa   output format  for each test case output a new line containing the answer — the maximum possible value across all permutations of aa   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤⋅≤n≤⋅ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ ai≠ajai≠aj for i≠ji≠j the sum of nn across all test cases wont exceed ⋅⋅                          sample input                                                              sample output                              explanation test case  the value of any permutation is modmodmodmod  test case  the  cyclic permutations of the given array and their corresponding values are   with value   with value   with value   with value   with value   with value   among these the highest value is    author ★iceknight tags                                   dynamicprogramming easymedium greedy iceknight ltime                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
