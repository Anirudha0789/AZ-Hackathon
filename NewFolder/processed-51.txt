 assume youre the owner of xmas factory located in udyambag belagavi  this xmas factory is well known for producing highquality toy cars including christmas gifts for kids  these toy cars when turned on moves forward and autonomously navigates   there are mm different types of toy cars  each type of toy car has nn number cars  there are mm number of machines which produce cars of its corresponding type  for example a type  machine would produce type  car only  there is only one machine for each type  each machine has a special button that reverses the logic of the circuit used in the toy car   for example if the logic circuit of the car is designed to move forward when turned on then by pressing this special button on this machine the car produced would move backward instead of moving forward similarly if the logic circuit of the car is designed to move backward when turned on then by pressing this special button on this machine the car produced would move forward instead of moving backward thus revering the logic  kk is the number of machines in which this special button is turned on   a car is said to have correct logic if and only if it moves forward when turned on  a car is said to have incorrect logic if it moves backward when turned on   the factory has produced mmnn number of toy cars  out of which there are some faulty cars produced with incorrect logic  in order to correct the logic all the cars are put back into corresponding types of machine  if kk is the number of machines in which the special button is turned on pressed you being the owner want to know what maximum number of cars could be produced with correct logic  input  first line will contain single integer tt indicating the number of test cases  for each test case the first line contains  integers namely mm nn and kk where mm is the total number of types of toy cars  nn is the total number of toy cars produced in each type and kk is the exact number of special buttons that will be turned on  for each of the next mm lines there is a single integer between  and n that indicates the number of cars that are with correct logic   output for each testcase output in a single line answer indicating the maximum number of toy cars with correct logic  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤k≤m≤≤k≤m≤ ≤n≤≤n≤  sample input                                          sample output             explanation there are two test cases in this sample test file  in the first test case there are two types of cars with each type having in total  number of cars  since there are two types of cars there would be corresponding two types of machines producing it  in the first type say type  both the cars have correct logic and in the second type say type  both the cars have incorrect logic  since kk the special button of the type  machine can be turned on to correct the logic of both the type  cars  hence all the cars can be implemented with correct logic  in the second test case there are two types of cars with each type having in total  number of cars  since there are two types of cars there would be corresponding two types of machines producing it  in the first type say type   all the cars have incorrect logic and in the second type say type   car has incorrect logic and remaining  cars have correct logic  since kk   the special button on both the machines must be turned on  as a result the number of cars with correct logic implemented are  from type  and  from type   author ★xxmaverickxx editorial  codechef comproblemssntfac tags                                   array basicmath hard lists logical nyre sorting xxmaverickxx                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
