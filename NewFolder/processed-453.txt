 the chef has n arrays each array has an m number of elements   for each array given you have to find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no two numbers in the sequence should be adjacent to each other in the array and store it in the new array which will be of the size n   now you have a  single new array of size n  from that find the minimum sum of a subsequence by using the maximum number of elements in an array with the constraint that no two numbers in the sequence should be adjacent to each other in the array and print it  input the first line of input contains t test cases   for each test case there are two integers nmnm   for next n lines each line contains m integers  output the answer is a single line output printing a number  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤  sample input                                     sample output   explanation this list is  from      gives  as maximum sumsum of subsequence     gives  as maximum sumsum of subsequence     gives  as maximum sumsum of subsequence    after this we get an array of size n with elements found above i e  now   gives  as the minimum sumsum of subsequence   hence the answer is    author ★dhussa editorial  codechef comproblemsdynmcprg tags                                   clag dhussa dynamicprogramming easymedium greedy                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
