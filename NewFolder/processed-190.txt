 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese russian vietnamese and bengali as well  you are given a strictly convex polygon with nn vertices numbered  through nn  for each valid ii the coordinates of the iith vertex are xiyixiyi  you may perform the following operation any number of times including zero  consider a parent polygon  initially this is the polygon you are given  draw one of its child polygons ― a simple nondegenerate polygon such that each of its sides is a chord of the parent polygon it cannot be a side of the parent polygon  the operation cannot be performed if the parent polygon does not have any child polygons  the child polygon which you drew becomes the new parent polygon   your goal is to draw as many sides of polygons in total as possible including the polygon given at the start  find this maximum total number of sides  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  nn lines follow  for each valid ii the iith of these lines contains two spaceseparated integers xixi and yiyi   output print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible number of sides of polygons  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ xiyi≤xiyi≤ for each valid ii the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅                         sample input                                                                              sample output                              explanation example case  it is not possible to draw a child polygon  example case  we can draw a child polygon once e g  with vertices −−−− −− and   even though there are several other ways to draw a child polygon it can only be a triangle so the total number of sides cannot exceed    author ★pandeyji editorial  codechef comproblemspolyrel tags                                   geometry greedy                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
