 mister j is a very distinguished professor but he also has a dark side to him  he feels being free is a waste of time and therefore he wants his students to be permanently busy  the students have nn vacation days which are vv…vnvv…vn all distinct  administration ensures that students get a minimum of  such vacation days  mister j has a set of projects each of which occupies the students from dd to dt−dt− days inclusive from the announcement date dd  different projects timelines may or may not overlap  he can deploy at most mm projects each of which occupies the students for the same number of days tt  he can choose any announcement date dd for each project it can be different for different projects   but he does not want to get into trouble with the administration for issuing very lengthy projects  so he needs your help in finding the minimum integer value of tt such that he is still able to use his set of mm projects to occupy the students for every single vacationday that they get  mister j doesnt want the projects to be too short so he ensures that the number of projects mm is less than the number of days nn  input the first line of input contains  integers nn ≤n≤≤n≤ and mm ≤m≤mn≤m≤mn  the next line contains nn spaceseparated integers v…vnv…vn ≤vi≤≤vi≤ all vivi are distinct output output only one integer the minimum possible value of tt  sample input           sample output    explanation mister j can deploy three projects  the first project will cover the vacation days  and  the second project will cover the vacation days  and  and the last project will cover the vacation days  and   therefore we can minimize the project length to  days cover all the vacation days and give ≤≤ projects  hack case note find the buggy solution to this problem on github or drive  this problem is part of decode contest wherein you are given a problem as given above and its buggy solution link in contest announcement  you have to submit a program that outputs a hack case to the buggy solution  your programs output should satisfy the input constraints of the above problem   author ★akcube editorial  codechef comproblemsprojover tags                                   akcube binarysearch                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
