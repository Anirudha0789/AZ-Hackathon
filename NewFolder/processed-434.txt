 first yearites are repeatedly asking for fresher’s party to second yearites  but being responsible enough second yearites know that it is not a safe time for parties and they want to avoid overcrowding  so as of now they decided to give every junior a packet of toffees and promised them a party in near future and to which juniors agreed upon  so utkarsh and jaskaranboth second yearites went to a shop to buy toffees for nn juniors  the shopkeeper has mm packets of toffees and each packet may contain different number of toffees  to be more specific first packet contains ff number of toffees the second packet consists of ff number of toffees and so on  utkarsh and jaskaran don’t want to upset juniors  so they decided that difference between the number of toffees in the packets to be as least as possible  let aa be the number of toffees in the largest packet that they buy and aa be the number of toffees in the smallest packet they buy  now they want to buy n packets in such a way that a−aa−a is minimum possible    input the first line contains spaceseparated integers nn and mm    the second line contains mm spaceseparated integers fufu   ufmfufu   ufm  — the quantities of toffees in the packets sold in the shop   output print a single integer — the least possible difference the teacher can obtain   constraints ≤nm≤≤nm≤ ≤fi≤≤fi≤  subtasks subtask  points ≤nm≤≤nm≤ subtask   points original constraints  sample input            sample output    explanation  choose     as  integers  so aa will be  and aa will be   therefore difference will be    author pecchapter editorial  codechef comproblemsfrshp tags                                   cakewalk greedy pecchapter sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
