 today tomya buys n retort pouches of food in chef ciels restaurant  the ith retort pouch contains vi units of food and its useby date is the uith day origin  moreover food from the ith retort pouch can be eaten only within li days after it was opened  namely if tomya will open the ith retort pouch on the xith day she can eat food units from it on the kth day if and only if xi ≤ k ≤ minui xili−  the retort pouches in ciels restaurant are designed in such a way that if vi  vj then ui ≤ uj  tomya will eat at most two units of food everyday  however after the minui xili−th day uneaten food units in the ith retort pouch must be discarded  your task is to decide when to open each of the retort pouches and which food units to eat each day in such a way that the number of discarded units will be minimum  there is also a restriction that once you open some pouch food units from previously opened pouches should be discarded  the above restriction is an addition to the problem statement that was made after the contest  we are extremely sorry about that  we all had missed the possibility to achieve better score without this restriction in some situations  we are grateful to mikhail kever for pointing out our mistake  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains an integer n denoting the number of retort pouches  each of the following n lines contains  space separated integers vi ui li denoting the parameters of the ith pouch  output for each test case output a single line containing the minimum number of food units which tomya must discard  constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ vi ui li ≤     if vi  vj then ui ≤ uj the sum of n in one test file does not exceed    example input                           output    explanation example case   one of the optimal ways is the followingthe st pouch is opened on the day x  the nd pouch is opened on the day x  the rd pouch is opened on the day x  thenthe st pouch is available at the interval  the nd pouch is available at the interval  the rd pouch is available at the interval   on days    tomya eats  units of the nd pouch each day on days     tomya eats  units of the st pouch each day on day  tomya eats  units of the rd pouch in this case tomya discard the  unit of the st pouch and  units of the rd pouch  example case   there is only one optimal way as followsthe st pouch is opened on the day x  the nd pouch is opened on the day x  the rd pouch is opened on the day x  thenthe st pouch is available at the interval  the nd pouch is available at the interval  the rd pouch is available at the interval   on days   tomya eats  units of the st pouch each day on day  tomya eats  unit of the st pouch and  unit of the nd pouch on days    tomya eats  units of the nd pouch each day on days     tomya eats  units of the rd pouch each day in this case tomya can eat all units of food  example case   please note that here l is larger than u   author hirotoadm tester ★antonlunyov editorial  codechef comproblemsavdwast tags                                   cook greedy hirotoadm mediumhard                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
