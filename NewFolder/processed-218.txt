  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  sereja has an array a    n which contains n integers  now sereja wants to sort it  the only thing that sereja can do is to reverse all elements in some subarray which is a consecutive parts of a  in other words in one operation sereja can choose two integers l and r   l  r  n and swap elements al and ar al and ar al and ar and so on   in such operation of l r the total energy that sereja spends r  l    clearly sereja wants to minimize the spent energy  also sereja would like to minimize the total number of all operations  therefore we give a mixed objective as shown in scoring   input  first line contains an integer n  next line contains a sequence of integers a a a     an   output  first line contains an integer q  the total number of operations you need to sort the array  in each of next q lines there should be two integers l and r   l  r  n indicate the operation that sereja should do  also you should remember that q shouldnt be greater than n   scoring  suppose s is the total spent energy of your output i e  the sum of r  l   of all operations  your score is s  n  q   lower scores will earn more points   we have  official test files  you must correctly solve all test files to receive ok  during the contest your overall score is the sum of the scores on the first  test files  after the contest all solutions will be rescored by the sum of the scores on the rest  test files  note that public part of the tests may not contain some border cases   constraints   n     ai   example input        output          author serejaadm editorial  codechef comproblemsseasort tags                                   challenge greedy heuristic march serejaadm                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
