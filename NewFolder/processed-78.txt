 in the cursed land of earth where all crops are failing tom cooper is trying to grow nn acres of crop this season and he can grow one crop in an acre  tom has two sets of nn crop seeds each  in the two sets the two ithith crop seeds are the same type crop  the first set of nn crop seeds are independent and each of them require their own preparation and can be grown independently  the ithith crop under this category will take a cost of xixi  the second set of nn crops are genetically modified to withstand extreme conditions and even withstand the intense dust storms  but there is one thing to allot a proper usage of resources the crops are designed in such a way that the ithith crop can be directly grown without fertiliser or other resource if the genetically modified i−thi−th crop is grown that is for example the waste material of the i−thi−th crop can be fertiliser for the ithith crop etc  thus he can grow the ithith crop in them in a constant cc cost along with a preparation cost of ckicki but if he has also grown the i−thi−th genetically modified crop he can skip the preparation cost and grow the ithith crop in just cc cost  since the world market expects a lot of variety in the crops available tom wants to maximize the number of different types of crops he grows  that is for example tom can grow only genetically modified crop  on all his fields  in that case he grows  crop  tom wants to maximize this number of crops he grows  note that growing both genetically modified and normal versions of the same crop count as growing  crop only and not   thus tom wants you to find out the maximum number of different crops he can grow and the corresponding minimum cost at which he can grow n sets of crops  input format  the first line contains tt the number of test cases  for each test case the first line contains two numbers nn and cc  the second line has nn integers xxxx…xnxn  the third line has nn integers kkkk…knkn   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤c≤≤c≤ ≤xi≤≤xi≤ ≤ki≤≤ki≤  output format for each test case output a line having two integers  the maximum number of different crops that can be grown and the minimum cost thatll be taken for this set of crops  sample input                       sample output       author ★shriramc editorial  codechef comproblemssopc tags                                   array dynamicprogramming sapc shriramc                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
