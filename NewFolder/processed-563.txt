  after winning numerous programming competitions malvika has got bored of participating and is thinking of holding her own series of contests named advanced contests by malvika indias coolest programming contests acmicpc  each contest will have three problems one each of easy medium and hard levels  now after some time malvika realized that creating hard problems for a contest is not as easy for her as solving them  so she asked her friend animesh to join the team and help her with it  animesh himself is no good with creating problems but he suggested her a clever strategy to reduce the number of hard problems she needs to create  he suggested that acmicpc could have three types of contests comprising of the following problem levels  type   easy  medium  hard type   easy  medium type   easy  medium  one day malvika and animesh sat down and prepared e easy problems m medium and h hard problems  as we know that it is harder to make higher difficulty problems the number of hard problems will be no more than medium and similarly the number of medium level problems will be no more than easy level  now they want to use the above problems to organizes a series of contests  also as they want the series to be interesting so they dont want to have two consecutive contests in the series to be of the same type  can you please help them in finding out the maximum number of contests they can conduct in the series  input  the first line of input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases  the only line of each test case contains three space separated integers — e m h — as defined in the statement   output  for each test case output a single integer in a line the answer to the problem   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ e m h ≤  h ≤ m ≤ e sum of variables e for all the test cases wont exceed    example input         output    explanation  in the first example they have  easy  medium and  hard problem  they can conduct one contest of type   this is the maximum number of contests they can conduct   in the second example they have  easy  medium and  hard problems  they can conduct  contests one each of type   and  which require a total of  easy  med and  hard problems  this is the maximum number of contests they can conduct  hence the answer is     author admin editorial  codechef comproblemschn tags                                   acmchn admin binarysearch                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages java c cpp pyp  submit
