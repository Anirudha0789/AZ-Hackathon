 you are provided with a weighted undirected graph gg and string ss  each node in gg has a letter attached to it  find the minimum cost of a walk in gg such that the path contains ss as a subsequence i e  ss can be formed by removing  or more characters from the string formed by the concatenation of letters on the nodes on the walk  you are allowed to begin as well as end your walk at any vertex  also you can visit any vertex any number of times  input  first line contains integer tt representing number of test cases  each test case is as follows  the first line contains integers nn and mm and xx  number of nodes and edges  and the length of string respectively  the second line contains string ss  the third line contains nn characters  ith character represents the letter attached to the ith node  following mm lines contain uxavxawuxavxaw  this means uu and vv are connected by an edge weight ww   output output a single integer that represents the minimum cost of the path that contains ss as a subsequence  if there is no path that contains ss as a subsequence then output   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nx≤≤nx≤ ≤m≤e≤m≤e ≤uv≤n≤uv≤n ≤w≤≤w≤ no two consecutive characters of string ss are same   subtasks   points  nn mm and xx ≤≤   points  original constraints   sample input     ababc a b b c                            sample output   explanation the path will be                     author ★rishik editorial  codechef comproblemsstrgra tags                                   akashbhalotia dijkstraalgorithm greedy ico icop medium rishik                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp pypy  submit
