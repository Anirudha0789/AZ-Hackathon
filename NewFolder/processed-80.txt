 given an array aa consisting of nn nonnegative integers   you need to perform the following operation n−n− times  sort the array aa in ascending order  let mm be the current size of the array aa  replace the array aa by a−aa−a…am−am−a−aa−a…am−am−  note that each time the operation is performed the size of the array reduces by one   find the remaining element after n−n− operations  input format  the first line contains an integer tt denoting number of test cases  the tt test cases then follow  the first line of each test case contains an integer nn  the size of the array  the second line of each test case contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an   output format for each test case output single line the remaining element after n−n− operations  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅                          sample input                                                             sample output                              explanation  test case  the operations look like operation  sort the array  now aa becomes   replace the array  thus a−−−a−−−  operation  sort the array  now aa becomes   replace the array  thus a−−a−−  operation  sort the array  now aa becomes   replace the array  thus a−a−   thus the remaining element after  operations is    test case  since nn you dont need to perform any operation  the remaining element after  operations is     author ★wwwww editorial  codechef comproblemsarrayops tags                                   arrays sorting                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
