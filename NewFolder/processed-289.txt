 read problem statements in mandarin russian and vietnamese as well  you have an n×nn×n matrix aa  you can rearrange the elements of the matrix in any way  let mm…mnmm…mn be the medians of each row in aa after the rearrangement  the goodness of the matrix aa is defined as the minimum median among the medians of all rows i e minmm…mnminmm…mn  naturally rearranging values also comes with a cost  the cost of rearrangement is defined as mm⋯mnmm⋯mn   find the maximum goodness you can achieve after rearranging a matrix aa such that the cost of rearrangement doesnt exceed kk or −− if the answer doesnt exist  the median of an array aa consisting of nn elements is the ⌈n⌉th⌈n⌉th smallest element of aa  the median of  is  and the median of  is   input format  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case consists of two spaceseparated integers nn and kk  nn lines follow each consisting of nn spaceseparated integers denoting the matrix aa  output format for each test case print a single line containing one integer  the maximum goodness you can achieve such that the rearrangement cost does not exceed kk or  if the answer doesnt exist  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤≤k≤ ≤aij≤≤aij≤ ≤∑n≤≤∑n≤  subtasks  subtask   points kk subtask   points ≤∑n≤≤∑n≤ subtask   points original constraints                         sample input                                                                                                     sample output                               explanation test case   we rearrange the matrix as follows ⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥   the medians of each row are  respectively  the goodness is  and the cost is   there are other rearrangements that may yield the same goodness but  is the maximum goodness we can get   test case   the rearranged matrix is ⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥   the medians of each row are  respectively  the goodness is  and the cost is   there are other rearrangements that may yield the same goodness but  is the maximum goodness we can get   test case   no matter how we rearrange the elements the cost is always greater than kk   author ★saarang editorial  codechef comproblemsmedmax tags                                   d arrays basic maths greedy sorting binary search prefix sum                                                              data structures arrays mathematics algorithms searching simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
