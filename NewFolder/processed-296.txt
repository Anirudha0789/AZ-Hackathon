 read problems statements in mandarin chinese  russian and vietnamese as well  professor gukiz decided to distribute all of his candies to his nn students numbered  through nn  lets denote the number of candies gukiz gave to the iith student by pipi  as gukiz has a lot of students he does not remember all the exact numbers of candies he gave to the students  he only remembers the following properties of the sequence pp  the numbers of candies given to each of the first kk students pp…pkpp…pk are known exactly  all elements of the sequence pp are distinct  the difference between the maximum and minimum element of the sequence pp does not exceed xx  the professor gave out the biggest possible total number of candies i e  sppp…pnsppp…pn is maximum possible   normally professors never lie so the information provided by gukiz is valid and there is at least one sequence that satisfies all conditions  gukiz would like to know the total number of candies ss he had at the beginning  can you help him find this number input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains three spaceseparated integers nn kk and xx  the second line contains kk spaceseparated integers pp…pkpp…pk   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer — the number of candies gukiz had  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤k≤minn⋅≤k≤minn⋅  ≤x≤≤x≤ ≤pi≤≤pi≤ for each valid ii there is at least one valid distribution of candies to students                         sample input                                                                  sample output                              explanation example case  there are four students  we know that the first student got pp candies the second student got pp and the third got pp candies we dont know the number of candies given to the last student  the difference between the maximum and minimum number of candies given to students is already −x−x so the fourth student could only have been given between  and  candies  it cant be  either so we maximize the number of candies if we give  candies to the fourth student  in total there are  candies  example case  we know the number of candies given to each of the two students so we know that gukiz had  candies   author ★allllekssssa editorial  codechef comproblemsguzac tags                                   sorting                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
