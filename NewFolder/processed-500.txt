  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian   chef has just been introduced to functions and he has been experimenting a lot with the different kinds of functions  in the process the chef has come up with an interesting problem for you    chef defines a function  rooti x  which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the  i th root of a positive integer  x   for example  root   is     and  root   is        now the chef defines another function  valx a n  as follows   valx a n   root xa    root xa         rootn xan    where  a  is an array of integers of size  n  indexed from  onwards  and  x  is a positive integer    you are given the array  a  and its size  n   you need to find out the value of  valx a n  for several values of  x   since this number can be very large print the result modulo        input  the first line contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  each test case begins with a line containing two integers n and  q  denoting the size of array a and the number of queries  the second line of each test case consists of n space separated integers where the ith integer represents ai  the third line of each test case consists of q space separated integers denoting the value of  x  for the ith query   output  for each test case print in a single line  q  integers where the ith integer represents the answer to the ith  query   i e  valx a n          constraints   ≤  t ≤        ≤  n  ≤      ≤  q  ≤     ≤  ai   ≤      ≤  x   ≤    for each number in the query                           sample input                                                             sample output                              explanation query   root  root  root                   query   root  root  root                    author vivekadm tester ★shiplu editorial  codechef comproblemsfunc tags                                   mathematics binary search prefix sum                                                              algorithms searching simple algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
