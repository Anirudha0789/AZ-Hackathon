 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given a multiset s of n integers and an integer k  you want to find the maximum value of minimal excluded nonnegative integer mex of the multiset given that you are allowed to add at most any k integers to the multiset  find the maximum value of mex that you can obtain   few examples of finding mex of a multiset are as follows  mex of multiset  is   is     is        is   input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of testcases  the first line of each test case contains two space seperated integers n and k denoting the size of the multiset and the maximum number of extra integers that you can add in the multiset respectively  the second line contains n space separated integers denoting the multiset s s s      sn   output for each testcase output the answer in a single line   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ k ≤   ≤ si ≤     subtasks  subtask   points k  subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                          sample output                                explanation example case   as k   so we cant add any element to the multiset  elements of the set are     the mex value of this set is   example case   as k   you are allowed to add at most  element to the multiset  the multiset are     you can add element  to the multiset and it becomes      the mex value of this multiset is   there is no other way to have higher value of mex of the set by adding at most one element to the multiset   author ★hruday tester ★alexoo editorial  codechef comproblemsmex tags                                   sets greedy sorting                                                              data structures algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
