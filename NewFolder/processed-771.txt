 the little elephant from the zoo of lviv likes listening to music  there are n songs numbered from  to n in his mpplayer  the song i is described by a pair of integers bi and li  the band represented as integer that performed that song and the length of that song in seconds  the little elephant is going to listen all the songs exactly once in some order  the sweetness of the song is equal to the product of the length of that song and the number of different bands listened before including the current playing song  help the little elephant to find the order that maximizes the total sweetness of all n songs  print that sweetness   input  the first line of the input contains single integer t denoting the number of test cases  then t test cases follow  the first line of each test case contains single integer n denoting the number of the songs  the next n lines describe the songs in the mpplayer  the ith line contains two spacesparated integers bi and li   output for each test output the maximum total sweetness   constraints  ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤    ≤ bi li ≤                           sample input                                                                    sample output                              explanation in the first sample if he listens the songs in given order thenb l the sweetness      b l the sweetness      b l the sweetness      so the total sweetness is   in this case you can check the total sweetness does not depend on the order of the songs  in the second sample if he listens the songs in given order thenb l the sweetness      b l the sweetness      b l the sweetness      so the total sweetness is   however he listens the song  firstly thenb l the sweetness      b l the sweetness      b l the sweetness      so the total sweetness is  and it is the maximum total sweetness   author ★witaliyadm tester ★laycurse editorial  codechef comproblemslemusic tags                                   april easy greedy sorting witaliyadm                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon pike scm qobi st nem  submit
