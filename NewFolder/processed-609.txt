 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  in the nation of chefland there are villages at coordinates xyxy whenever xx and yy are nonzero odd coprime integers  xx can be either positive or negative but yy is always positive  in each village xyxy there is a crossroads with the roads marked north south east west  road east leads to xyyxyy  road west leads to x−yyx−yy  road north leads to either xyxxyx or −x−yx−x−yx  chosen so that the new yy coordinate is positive  road south leads to either xy−xxy−x or −x−y−x−x−y−x chosen so that the new yy coordinate is positive    some citizens of chefland prefer these equivalent definitions for the north and south roads road north leads to xyx−x−yxwhenxayxwhenxayxxyxwhenxayx−x−yxwhenxayx  road south leads to xy−x−x−y−xwhenxay−xwhenxay−xxy−xwhenxay−x−x−y−xwhenxay−x  the cost to travel a road between two adjacent villages is  pound  determine the minimum cost to travel between villages at xyxy and xyxy   notes  the road network is defined so that the villages form an undirected graph  there are two roads joining −− and  but otherwise there is a single road between any adjacent pair of villages  the road network does not form a simple grid  that would be too easy  input  first line will contain tt the number of testcases  then the testcases follow   each testcase contains a single line of input which has four integers xyxyxyxy    output for each testcase output in a single line the answer  that is the minimum cost in pounds to travel from xyxy to xyxy  constraints  t≤t≤   the coordinates xyxy and xyxy of the villages satisfy  −xx−xx and yyyy  subtasks   points  −xx−xx and yyyy   points  original constraints but the villages are selected so that the minimum cost for each testcase is   points −xx−xx and yyyy  points original constraints                         sample input                                                                          sample output                                 explanation in the first test case the start and end village coordinates are both  so the cost is   in the second test case from  go west to −− in one step  so the cost is   note that the south road from  also goes to −−  in the third test case from  go south to   from  go west to   from  go west to −−  from −− go west to −−  from −− go west to −−  from −− go north to    author ★johnsmith editorial  codechef comproblemsvillnet tags                                   binarysearch hard johnsmith lowestcommonancestor oct                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
