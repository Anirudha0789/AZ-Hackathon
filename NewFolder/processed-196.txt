 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chefs friend alex runs a movie theatre  due to the increasing number of platforms for watching movies online his business is not running well  as a friend alex asked chef to help him maximise his profits  since chef is a busy person he needs your help to support his friend alex    alexs theatre has four showtimes  pm  pm  pm and  pm  he has four movies which he would like to play ― lets call them a b c and d  each of these movies must be played exactly once and all four must be played at different showtimes  for each showtime the price of a ticket must be one of the following rs  rs  rs  or rs   the prices of tickets for different showtimes must also be different  through his app alex receives various requests from his customers  each request has the form i want to watch this movie at this showtime  lets assume that the number of people who come to watch a movie at a given showtime is the same as the number of requests for that movie at that showtime  it is not necessary to accommodate everyones requests ― alex just wants to earn the maximum amount of money  there is no restriction on the capacity of the theatre  however for each movie that is not watched by anyone alex would suffer a loss of rs  deducted from the profit  you are given nn requests alex received during one day  find the maximum amount of money he can earn on that day by choosing when to play which movies and with which prices   input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains a single integer nn  nn lines follow  each of these lines contains a character mm followed by a space and an integer tt describing a request to see the movie mm at the showtime tt   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum profit alex can earn possibly negative  finally print a line containing one integer ― the total profit over all test cases i e  over tt days  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ mm is a b c or d tt is    or   subtasks subtask   points it is possible to fulfill all requests subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                              a  b  c  a  b  c  d  b  d  b  b  c   a  a  b  c  d  a  b   a  b   d                            sample output                                    explanation example case  the following table shows the number of people that want to watch the movies at the given showtimes                 a               b                 c                 d               the maximum number of requests was sent for movie b at  pm  therefore we play this movie at this time and the tickets cost rs   next we play movie d at  pm with ticket price rs  and movie c at  pm with ticket price rs   finally we have a slot for  pm and the only movie we can play at that time now is movie a with ticket price rs   the total profit is ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅  since each movie was watched by at least one person there is no additional loss  example case  just like above we show the requests in a table                 a               b                 c                 d               the optimal solution is to play movie a at  pm movie b at  pm movie c at  pm and movie d at  pm with decreasing ticket prices in this order  the profit is ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅  example case  again we show the requests in a table                 a               b                 c                 d               the optimal solution is to play movie a at  pm with ticket price rs  movie b at  pm with ticket price rs  and the remaining two movies in any order at  pm and  pm  either way there will be nobody watching them  we earn ⋅⋅⋅⋅ but we have to deduct rs  so the resulting profit is −−−−  example case  the optimal solution is to play movie d at  pm the other three movies go unattended  we have to deduct rs  so the profit is ⋅−−⋅−−  example case  since there are no requests for any movie at any time all movies go unattended and alex just suffers a loss of rs   the total profit for all  days is −−−−−−   author ★kushalgoel editorial  codechef comproblemstheatre tags                                   bruteforce feb greedy kushalgoel simple tmwilliamlin                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
