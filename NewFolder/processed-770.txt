  read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chef is playing a video game  in a video game theres a advanced civilization that has a total of n planets under control  all of those planets are connected with n teleports in such a way that its possible to travel between any two planets using those teleports  theres a chance that some planet gets infected  in this case it takes  hours for civilization to find out infection and prevent it from spreading  during this time infection uses teleport one time and infect all the planets that can be achieved in one teleport jump  so once infection is detected at planet v scientists already know that all planets connected to v via teleport are also infected  all the neccessary teleports are disabled right away and medics start working on eliminating the infection  each planet has population  planets are numbered from  to n and their populations are p p     pn  it is known that all the pi are distinct  theres a capital among all those planets  the capital is known to have the biggest population  once infection is detected at planet v after disabling teleports on planet v and all connected to them government has to establish a new capital if needed in the remaining notinfected planets  so they list all the planets that are not connected to v and are not v  then they pick the planet with biggest population  your task is to find the number of this planet for every possible v  input the first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases  the description of t test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains one integer n  next line contains n spaceseparated integers p p     pn denoting the population of each planet  next n lines contain two spaceseparated integers each v and u denoting that theres a teleport between planet v and u  output for each test case output a single line containing n integers a a     an separated by a space  here ai denotes the number of the planet picked to be new capital in case infection starts spreading from the planet i  in case infection affects all the planets output   constraints   ≤ t ≤   ≤ n ≤   ≤ pi ≤  all pi are distinct  ≤ v ≤ n  ≤ u ≤ n  subtasks  subtask   points n ≤  subtask   points n ≤  subtask   points no additional constraints                         sample input                                                                       sample output                                   author ★cenadar tester ★iscsi editorial  codechef comproblemscapimove tags                                   sets                                                              data structures                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
