 read problem statements in hindi bengali mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  chefs apartment consists of mm floors numbered  through mm and theres an elevator that is used to move between different floors  the elevator is connected with a computer which registers its movement in a sequence bb  whenever the elevator moves to a different floor the computer appends the new floor number to sequence bb  currently the sequence bb has nn elements  unfortunately the computer is infected with a virus which replaced some elements of bb by −−s  chef now wants to know what could be the minimum number of times the elevator has changed its direction  that is how many times the elevator was going up then started going down and vice versa   help chef by answering his question or determine that the sequence bb is invalid  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two integers nn and mm   the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers bb…bnbb…bn   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of times the elevator has changed its direction or −− if the given bb sequence is invalid  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤m≤≤m≤ ≤bi≤m≤bi≤m or bi−bi− for each valid ii sum of nn over all testcases doesnt exceed   subtasks subtask   points  n≤n≤ the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed   subtask   points original constraints sample input                                   sample output        author ★kingofnumbers editorial  codechef comproblemselevatr tags                                   dynamic programming greedy implementation                                                              algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
