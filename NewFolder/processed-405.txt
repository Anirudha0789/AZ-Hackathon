  read problems statements in mandarin chinese and russian as well  there are n cards placed in a row where every card has two numbers written on it one on the top and  one on the bottom  the numbers are between  and n both inclusive  every number is written on the top of exactly one card and on the bottom of exactly one card as well   chef wants to rearrange the cards such that the length of the longest common contiguous subsequence between the sequence formed by number written on top of the cards and that formed by those written on the bottom is maximum  he cant modify the numbers written on any card and cant flip the cards that is for any card the number written on top remains at the top and the number written on bottom stays at the bottom  find out the maximum possible length of the common contiguous subsequence   input the first line of input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases    the first line of each test case contains an integer n  the next line contains n space separated  integers a  a      an where ai ≤ i ≤ n is the number written on the top of the ith card  the next line contains n space separated  integers b  b      bn where bi ≤ i ≤ n is the number written at the bottom of the  ith card    output for each test case output a single line containing the integer l the maximum length of the longest common contiguous subsequence  constraints   ≤ t ≤     ≤ n ≤     ≤ ai bi ≤  n  all the elements in both arrays a and b are distinct                          sample input                                                                              sample output                              explanation  first example    one of the possible card arrangements is           length of the longest common contiguous subsequence between    and    is     and thats the maximum possible so answer is   second example   one of the possible card arrangements is                      the longest common contiguous subsequence has length      here  there is no way to arrange these cards such that its more than    note let l be the answer  let ci be the value written on the top of the card at ith position and di be the value written on the bottom of the card at ith position after rearranging  then there should be a pair x y   xy  nl such that the condition  cxj  dyj is satisfied for all j where   j  l                                                   author imranadm tester ★iscsi editorial  codechef comproblemscardline tags                                   longest common substring greedy cycles                                                              algorithms dynamic programming dp on sequences graph algos                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
