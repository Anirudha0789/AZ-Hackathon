 read problems statements in mandarin chinese russian and vietnamese as well  you are given two points pp and qq and an opaque sphere in a threedimensional space  the point pp is not moving while qq is moving in a straight line with constant velocity  you are also given a direction vector dd with the following meaning the position of qq at time tt is qtqd⋅tqtqd⋅t where qq is the initial position of qq  it is guaranteed that qq is not visible from pp initially at time tt  it is also guaranteed that pp and qq do not touch the sphere at any time  find the smallest positive time tvtv when qq is visible from pp i e  when the line segment connecting points pp and qq does not intersect the sphere  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first and only line of each test case contains  spaceseparated integers  the first three integers pxpypzpxpypz denote the coordinates of pp  the next three integers qxqyqzqxqyqz denote the initial coordinates of qq  the next three integers dxdydzdxdydz denote the components of the direction vector dd  the last four integers cxcyczrcxcyczr denote the coordinates of the centre of the sphere and its radius   output for each test case print a single line containing one real number — the time tvtv  your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed −−  it is guaranteed that tvtv exists and does not exceed   constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ the absolute values of coordinates of all points do not exceed ⋅⋅ ≤r≤≤r≤  subtasks subtask   points pzqzdzczpzqzdzcz subtask   points original constraints                          sample input                                                                   sample output                               author ★notsfast tester ★mgch tags                                   cross product binary search                                                              advanced algorithms computational geometry algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
