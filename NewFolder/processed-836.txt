 the chef has received a problem from his friend who is a chemist  he has got n candies  this all candies have some sucrose level  he has to eat such candy whose sucrose level is the difference of sucrose level of candy with maximum and minimum sucrose level  input  first line will contain tt number of testcases  then the testcases follow   each testcase contains of two line of input  firstline contains an integer n no of candies  secondline contains array a of sucrose level of all n candies   output for each test case output in a single line answer printing sucrose level of candy that chef will eat or printing  no if the chef doesnt find the candy with appropriate sucrose level he needs  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ ≤i≤n−≤i≤n−  sample input                  sample output    no  explanation for st test case this array is    here maximum sucrose level is  and minimum sucrose level is   their difference gives a sucrose level  which is present in a given array  hence the answer is   for nd test case this array is    here maximum sucrose level is  and the minimum sucrose level is   their difference gives a sucrose level  which is not present in a given array so he will not eat candy so we will print no  hence the answer is no   author ★dhussa editorial  codechef comproblemsdifrnce tags                                   cakewalk colg dhussa sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
