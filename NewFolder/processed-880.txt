  you are given n sticks where the length of each stick is a positive integer  a cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick  given the length of n sticks print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations  note for each cut operation you have to recalculate the length of smallest sticks excluding zerolength sticks   input  the first line contains a single integer n   the next line contains n integers separated by space where each integer represents the length of the ith stick   output  for each operation print the number of sticks that are cut on separate lines   constraints    n     stick length    example input         output      explanation stickslength        lengthofcut   stickscut                                                                                                                                                         done            done   author â˜…blackwell editorial  codechef comproblemsrel tags                                   blackwell easy irly sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
