 xa we all know electronthe smallest negatively charged particle and its properties  one of its important property is that they repel each other  these particle are quite familiar among quantum scientists  one such scientist dr  rakesh yadav need to place e electrons in a magnetic field for his experiment  after a long painstaking calculation he found n feasible coordinates along the xaxis  but to minimize the repelling force among electrons he wants to place the electrons such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible  this is again a vast calculation  so he wants you to help him find the largest minimum distance   xa input the first lint contains tthe number of test cases  the first line of each test cases contains two space separated integers n and e  the subsequent line contain n space separated integers xxx    denoting feasible position xa output for each test case output one integer the largest minimum distance constraints  ≤ t≤    ≤ n≤    ≤ e≤ n   ≤ xi≤  xa example input             output    xa explanation example case    we can put electrons in position  resulting in minimum distance   author ★saquibhere editorial  codechef comproblemsebase tags                                   binarysearch saquibhere                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
