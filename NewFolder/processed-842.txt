  ashish is an ece student at nit warangal  he had analog devices lab today  in todays experiment he had to study about the gain of the amplifiers  as usual he finished his experiment in half an hour  but as we all know how strict the rules are in ece department he is not allowed to leave the lab before  hours  he along with his lab partner bonnie was getting bored by just sitting there  but as ashish is a very curious student he started wondering what is the maximum output voltage he can attain by connecting all the amplifiers in series on giving some input signal  he asks bonnie to find out the same  bonnie is very busy talking with his other lab partners aditi and ankita so he wants your help   there are n amplifiers  each amplifier has a parameter pair ab which gives the relation between input and output signal for that amplifier  when a signal with magnitude x passes through ith amplifier its magnitude becomes aixbi  the amplifiers can be connected in any order  find the maximum output voltage that can be attained by connecting all amplifiers in series on giving input voltage of magnitude x  as the result can be very large find it modulo   assume amplifiers are powerful and can sustain very high voltages   input first line will contain t the number of test cases  then t test cases follow  first line of each test case contains an integer n the number of amplifiers  second line of each test case will contain an integer x the magnitude of input signal  each of next n lines contains two spaceseparated integers ab the parameter pair for each amplifier   output for each test case print the maximum output voltage that can be attained by connecting all the amplifiers in series modulo   constraints    t     n       x     ab    example input           output   author â˜…himkha editorial  codechef comproblemsnplqc tags                                   himkha maths nplq sorting                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
