  read problems statements in mandarin chinese  and russian  devu and churu love to play games a lot  today they have an array a consisting of n positive integers  first they listed all n × n   nonempty continuous subarrays of the array a on a piece of paper and then replaced all the subarrays on the paper with the maximum element present in the respective subarray  devu and churu decided to play a game with numbers on the paper  they both have decided to make moves turn by turn  in one turn the player picks some number from the list and discards that number  the one who is not able to make a valid move will be the loser  to make the game more interesting they decided to put some constraints on their moves  a constraint on a game can be any of following three types    k  they are allowed to choose numbers having values strictly greater than k only    k  they are allowed to choose numbers having values strictly less than k only    k  they are allowed to choose numbers having values equal to k only    given m constraints and who goes first you have to tell the outcome of each game  print d if devu wins otherwise print c without quotes  note that m games are independent that is theyll rewrite numbers by using array a after each game  this is the task for the loser of the previous game input  first line of input contains two space separated integers n and m denoting the size of array a and number of game played by them  next line of input contains n spaceseparated integers denoting elements of array a  each of the next m lines of input contains three spaceseparated parameters describing a game  first two parameter are a character c ∈    and an integer k denoting the constraint for that game  the last parameter is a character x ∈ d c denoting the player who will start the game    output  output consists of a single line containing a string of length m made up from characters d and c only where ith character in the string denotes the outcome of the ith game   constraints   ≤ n m ≤   ≤ ai k ≤   x ∈ d c c ∈    subtasks  subtask    ≤ n m ≤     pts  subtask    ≤ n m ≤     pts  subtask    ≤ n m ≤     pts                          sample input                                   d lt  c   d   c lt  d                          sample output                            dcddc explanation  subarray list              numbers on the paper after replacement               game   there are only  numbers   in the list game   there is only  number   in the list game   there are only  numbers   in the list game   there are no numbers   in the list  so the first player cannot make his move game   there are  numbers   in the list   author ★matermind tester ★laycurse editorial  codechef comproblemsdcgame tags                                   stacks implementation binary search                                                              data structures algorithms searching                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit   secs source limit  bytes languages pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl perl scala lua bash js lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj d caml fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp scm guile perl erl clps prlg ick nice icon scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
