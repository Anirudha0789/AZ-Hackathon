 alice has an array aa consisting of nn distinct integers  bob takes exactly n−n− elements from this array and adds a positive integer xx i e  xx to each of these numbers and then shuffles them to form a new array bb of length n−n−   you are given both arrays aa and bb  you have to identify the value of xx chosen by bob  if there are multiple possible values of xx print the smallest of them  it is guaranteed that for the given input there exists at least one possible value of xx  note since the input is large prefer using fast input methods  input format  the first line of input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  each test case contains  lines of input  the first line contains an integer nn  the length of array aa  the second line contains nn spaceseparated integers aa…anaa…an denoting the array aa  the third line contains n−n− spaceseparated integers bb…bn−bb…bn− denoting the array bb   output format for each test case output the value of xx chosen by bob  in case there are multiple possible values of xx print the smallest of them  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤n≤≤n≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ ≤bi≤⋅≤bi≤⋅ aa…anaa…an are pairwise distinct  bb…bn−bb…bn− are pairwise distinct  sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅                          sample input                                                                      sample output                               explanation test case  bob takes the elements  and adds  to them to obtain a new sequence   there is no other value of xx that can be added to the elements of aa to get bb  test case  there is only one option with bob to consider i e  to take element  and add  to it to get array bb  if he takes element  he will have to add −− which is not allowed   author utkarshadm editorial  codechef comproblemsremone tags                                   basic maths sorting                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
