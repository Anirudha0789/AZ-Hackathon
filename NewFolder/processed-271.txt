 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese russian vietnamese and bengali as well  there are nn light bulbs in a row numbered  through nn from left to right  each bulb can be in one of the states on or off  initially all the bulbs are off  each bulb is also connected to its at most two adjacent bulbs by wires  you should reach a state described by a given a binary string ss with length nn ― for each valid ii if the iith character of ss is  the iith bulb should be on and if it is  the iith bulb should be off  you may do that by performing the following steps in the given order  cut up to kk of the n−n− wires between adjacent bulbs possibly none of them  switch on some bulbs possibly none  here whenever two bulbs are still connected by wires directly or indirectly and one of them gets switched on then the other one also gets switched on  disconnect some bulbs from the electrical network  here disconnecting a bulb switches it off but it does not affect any other bulbs ― if a bulb was switched on before this step and it was not disconnected in this step it remains switched on afterwards   minimise the number of bulbs you need to disconnect in step  in order to reach the given final state of the bulbs  input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains two spaceseparated integers nn and kk  the second line contains a single string ss   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest number of bulbs you need to disconnect  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤kn≤≤kn≤ snsn ss contains only characters  and  the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed ⋅⋅                         sample input                                                         sample output                             explanation example case  we can cut the wires between pairs of bulbs  and  switch on bulbs   and  and then disconnect bulb    author ★manishtanwar editorial  codechef comproblemsbulbs tags                                   string arithmetic greedy adhoc                                                              data structures mathematics basic maths algorithms constructive                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
