 ankit has to submit his assignment given by his master  but ankits friends are calling him again and again to play cricket and ankit couldnt resist himself from playing cricket  so could you help him solving the problem formally you are given a sequence of nn positive integers bbbbb   bnbbbbb   bn and qq queries  in the ithith query ≤i≤q≤i≤q given a positive integer aiai find the aiaith smallest integer among the positive integers that differ from all of the bb   bnbb   bn  input format input is given in following format  nn qq bb bb        bnbn aa aa          aqaq output format print qq lines  the ithith line should contain the response to the ithith query  constraints  ≤nq≤≤nq≤ ≤bb   bn≤≤bb   bn≤ ≤ai≤≤ai≤ all values in input are integers                          sample input                                                              sample output                               explanation the positive integers that differ from all of bb   bnbb   bn are        in ascending order  the second fifth and third smallest of them are  and  respectively    author ★dexter tester ★dexter editorial  codechef comproblemsankckt tags                                   binarysearch dexter incb math                                                                                        difficulty rating                       na date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
