 read problems statements in hindi mandarin chinese russian vietnamese and bengali as well  chef has a memory machine  it has one layer for data storage and another layer for cache  chef has stored an array with length nn in the first layer lets denote its elements by aa…an−aa…an−  now he wants to load some elements of this array into the cache  the machine loads the array in blocks with size bb aa…ab−aa…ab− form a block abab…ab−abab…ab− form another block and so on  the last block may contain less than bb elements of chefs array  the cache may only contain at most one block at a time  whenever chef tries to access an element aiai the machine checks if the block where aiai is located is already in the cache and if it is not loads this block into the cache layer so that it can quickly access any data in it  however as soon as chef tries to access any element that is outside the block currently loaded in the cache the block that was previously loaded into the cache is removed from the cache since the machine loads a new block containing the element that is being accessed  chef has a sequence of elements axax…axmaxax…axm which he wants to access in this order  initially the cache is empty  chef is wondering how many times the machine will need to load a block into the cache layer  can you help him calculate this number input  the first line of the input contains a single integer tt denoting the number of test cases  the description of tt test cases follows  the first line of each test case contains three spaceseparated integers nn bb and mm  the second line contains mm spaceseparated integers xx…xmxx…xm   output for each test case print a single line containing one integer ― the number of times the machine loads a block into the cache  constraints  ≤t≤≤t≤ ≤nbm≤≤nbm≤ ≤xin≤xin for each valid ii                         sample input                                                            sample output                             explanation example case  the machine stores elements aaaaaa in one block and aaaa in another block  when accessing aa the block aaaaaa is loaded  then accessing aa removes the previous block from the cache and loads the block aaaa  finally when chef accesses aa a new block is not loaded since the block containing aa is currently loaded in the cache   author ★rezwanarefin editorial  codechef comproblemscachehit tags                                   basic maths brute force implementation                                                              mathematics algorithms                                                                                        difficulty rating                        date added  time limit  secs source limit  bytes languages cpp pyth   java c cpp pyth pyp cs ada pypy text pas fpc nodejs ruby php go hask tcl kotlin perl scala lua bash js rust lisp sbcl pas gpc bf cloj r d caml swift fort asm fs wspc lisp clisp sql scm guile perl erl clps prlg sqlq ick nice icon cob scm chicken pike scm qobi st nem  submit
