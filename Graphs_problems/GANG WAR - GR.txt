 First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
 Second line will contain NN,total number of people.
Third line will contain FF,total number of friend list.
Fourth line will contain a space separated two integers A,BA,B,means A is friend to B.

Output:

For each testcase, output in a single line YeSYeS if it is possible or NoNo if it is not.
