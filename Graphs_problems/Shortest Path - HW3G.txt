You are given a weighted undirected graph. The vertices are enumerated from 1 to nn. Your task is to find the shortest path between vertex 1 and vertex nn.
Input

The first line contains two integers nn and mm (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ m ≤ 105)(2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ m ≤ 105), where nn is the number of vertices and mm is the number of edges. 
Following mm lines contain one edge each in form ai,biai,bi and wiwi (1≤ai,bi≤n,1≤wi≤106)(1≤ai,bi≤n,1≤wi≤106), where ai, biai, bi are edge endpoints and wiwi is the length of the edge.
It is possible that the graph has loops and multiple edges between pair of vertices.

Output
Write the only integer -1 in case of no path. Write the shortest path in opposite case. If there are many solutions, print any of them.
