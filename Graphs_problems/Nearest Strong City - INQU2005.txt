During world war 11, there were NN cities and MM roads connecting cities in a country. Each jthjth road in the country is of particular distance DjDj and each ithith city has population AiAi.
There was a secret message of the enemy intercepted which tells that enemy is going to attack the roads of the country. If an enemy attacks a particular road then that road becomes unusable. 
Let us say that those roads which do not stop movement from one city to another if they are destroyed are called strong roads. In other words, a road is called strong road if after removal of only this road out of MM roads in graph there remains a path between any two cities. Roads which are not strong are referred as weak roads. 
Enemy is going to destroy all the weak roads of a country. Cities which are connected to at least KK strong roads are called strong cities and rest are weak cities. Government decided to move all citizens which are in weak cities to strong cities.
For each weak city, find out the distance to nearest strong city. Find sum of all such distances. If there does not exist a path to strong city from some weak city then the population of this weak citiy cannot be saved from enemy attack. Find the sum of population which cannot be saved from enemy attack.     
Constraints

1≤M≤2∗1051≤M≤2∗105
1≤K≤2∗1051≤K≤2∗105
1≤Ai≤1051≤Ai≤105
1≤Di≤1051≤Di≤105

Input Format

First line contains 3 space seperated integers NN MM KK
The Second Line contains NN space seperated integers where ithith element denotes the population of ithith city. 
MM lines, each line containing 3 space seperated integers xx, yy, DiDi which means there is a road from xx to yy with DiDi distance. (xx != yy).

Output Format

Two  space seperated integers AA and BB 
Where AA denotes the total distance to be calculated as explained above.
Where BB denotes the total population to be calculated as explained above.

Explanation
The road between 44 and 55 is weak road as if it is removed there is no path to go from 44 to 55. Rest all roads are strong roads. 44 and 22 are weak cities as they have only 2 strong roads which is less than K=3K=3. 11 and 33 are strong cities as both of them have 3 strong roads. Therefore, after removing weak roads, there is no path to any strong city from weak city 55. Hence required sum of population is 4141. 22 is a weak city with nearest strong city 11 at a distance of 33. 44 is a weak city with nearest strong city 11 at a distance of 22. Therefore, sum of distances is 33 ++ 22 == 55.
