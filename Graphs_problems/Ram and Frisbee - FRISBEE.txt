Today, Ram and friends have come out to play.
Ram has brought a Frisbee for today's game!    
Ram has NN friends numbered from 11 to NN , and they decided to play for XX minutes.    
The game's rules are as follows: 

All players stand in a circle.
Ram starts the game and passes the frisbee to one (it can be anyone) of his friends.
Any player who recieves the frisbee is free to pass the frisbee towards any other player immediately (no time gap).
The frisbee takes 11 minute to go from one player to another (regardless of the distance).
The game will end after XX minutes have completed (the frisbee recieved at the end of the last minute is counted).

They will be happy if before the end of the game , every player has interacted with the other NN players at least once.
Recieving and passing frisbee both count as interactions.
Ex- If player AA passes the frisbee to player BB, 
it can be said that player AA has interacted with player BB and player BB has interacted with player AA as well.
Note: Total number of players is N+1N+1 (including Ram himself).
Given NN and XX , you are to print if Ram and friends will be happy or not. 

Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,XN,X. 
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line "Happy" if they will complete the game before the end else  print "Unhappy" if they won't be able to complete the game before the end.

Constraints

1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
1≤N≤100001≤N≤10000
1≤X≤1091≤X≤109
Sample Input:
2
2 2
2 3

Sample Output:
Unhappy
Happy

EXPLANATION:
In the first case there are a total of 3 people and time left is 2 minutes, 
So it's not possible for every player to interact with the other 2 players.
In the second case there are a total of 3 people and time left is 3 minutes,
So it's possible for every player to interact with the other 2 players.
One possible way is [Ram->1, 1->2, 2->Ram].
