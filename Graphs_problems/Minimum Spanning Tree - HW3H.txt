Omar is attending an algorithms course and today they had a lecture about graphs. He wants to practice on some graph problems and he come across a description of a graph “It is an undirected weighted graph on nn vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly mm edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0”.
Omar decides to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you help Omar find the answer?
Input

The first line of the input contains two integers nn and mm (1≤n≤105,0≤m≤min(n(n−1)2,105)(1≤n≤105,0≤m≤min(n(n−1)2,105), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph.
The ii-th of the next mm lines contains two integers aiai and bibi (1≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi)(1≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi), the endpoints of the ii-th edge of weight 1.
It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.

Output
Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

Note

The graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight 0, other edges have weight 1. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight 2.

In the second sample, all edges have weight 0 so any spanning tree has total weight 0.
