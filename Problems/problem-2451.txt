Satkkeerthi has decided to participate in the Game of Stones. There are nn cities numbered 11 to nn and mm directeddirected
roadsroads between the cities. 
There is an infinitely large pile of stones in each city, of one particular colour. Each colour is described by a colour code, ai at the ith city.  
A player must choose a path starting from one city, and at every city along the path, he/she adds one stone to the collection at hand. The score of a player is defined as the maximum number of stones collected of aa particularparticular colourcolour. Help Satkkeerthi maximize his score and be declared the bearer of an aptronym!
Input:
The first line of input contains two integers nn,mm,the number of cities and the number of roads connecting them, respectively.
The second line contains nn integers separated by a space, ai denoting the colourcolour codecode of the stone at city i.
Then mm lines follow, where each line contains two integers xx and yy, indicating that there is a directeddirected road from city xx to city yy. We remind you that xx and yy may be equal, and do notnot guarantee complete connectivity of all cities.
Output:
Print a single integer, the maximum score which Satkkerthi can achieve. If his score can be arbitrarily large, print -1.
