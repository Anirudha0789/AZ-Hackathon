You are given a rooted tree consisting of nn vertices numbered 11 to nn.
The root of the tree is vertex number 11.
You are given QQ queries. The  ii-th query consists of a set of kk distinct vertices.
In each query, you have to find the Godfather node. A Godfather node is a node in the given set which lies in the unique simple paths from all the kk vertices to the root.   
Input:

First-line will contain 22 integers nn and QQ.   
Next, n−1n−1 lines contain two integers uu and vv describing an edge of the tree.
Next QQ lines describe queries.
ii-th query starts with an integer kk - number of integers in the current query. Then kk integers from which you have to find the godfather. 

Output:
For each query, print a single line containing one integer - The godfather node if it exists, else −1−1.

EXPLANATION:
Sample 1: query 1.
Paths.
Root to vertex 33 [1,3][1,3]
Root to vertex 77 [1,3,7][1,3,7]
Root to vertex 99 [1,3,7,9][1,3,7,9]
Root to vertex 1010 [1,3,7,9,10][1,3,7,9,10]
Here vertex 33 lies in the paths from vertices 3, 7,9 and 10 to root.
So vertex 33 is the godfather node.
Sample 1:Query 2.
Root to vertex 55 [1,2,5][1,2,5]
Root to vertex 66 [1,2,6][1,2,6]
No godfather node exists from given kk integers.
