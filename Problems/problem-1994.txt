For each problem i, Fluffy knows that there are xi possible scores that a contestant may achieve. (note that it possible that a contestant cannot achieve a zero score on some problems, and it may happen that there are duplicates in the possible scores a contestant may achieve.) The possible scores that a contestant may achieve for problem i are s1, s2, ..., sxi. 

Now, Fluffy would like to know the possible scores a contestant can get for the whole contest. The score of a contestant is the sum of his scores on each problem. For example, if someone gets 2 points on problem 1, 10 points on problem 2 and 13 points on problem 3, then he gets 2 + 10 + 13 = 25 points in total. Can you output the list of possible scores a contestant can obtain?

 
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer n, the number of problems. Next, n lines follow. The i-th line contains the possible scores of the i problem. The first number on the line is xi, the number of possible scores for problem i. Next, xi numbers follow, denoting the possible scores one can obtain for the i-th problem.

 
Output
Output all possible scores a contestant may obtain. Suppose there are m possible scores. You should output m space-seperated integers which denotes all possible scores. Note that each possible score should appear exactly once in the output. You should also output the scores in increasing order.
 
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 20
2 ≤ xi ≤ 300000
0 ≤ Possible Score of a Problem ≤ 1000000
The product of all xi does not exceed 300000

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (21 points) : n = 2
Subtask 2 (38 points) : xi = 2
Subtask 3 (41 points) : Original Constraints

 
Example
Input:
3
2 6 4
3 3 0 3
2 2 1

Output:
5 6 7 8 9 10 11

 
Explanation
Example case. The possible scores that one can get is : 6 + 3 + 2 = 11, 6 + 3 + 1 = 10, 4 + 3 + 2 = 9, 4 + 3 + 1 = 8, 6 + 0 + 1 = 7, 4 + 0 + 2 = 6, 4 + 0 + 1 = 5. (Note that there are other possible combinations but they'll give one of these scores) It can be proven that other scores are unobtainable.
