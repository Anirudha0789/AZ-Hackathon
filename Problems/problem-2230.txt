The recruitment drive of Technical club of BBDNITM is taking place. The interviewers has a level NN associated with them, and he is only interested in finding the number of ways to reach that level. So every student who comes for interview they ask only one question, "How many ways are available to you to reach our level?". Given that the student can increase his/her level either by 11 (clearing single semester at a time) or by 22 (clearing both semester at the same time) at a time.
There is a panel of TT interviewers, each having his own level NN.
Initially, the level of student is considered to be 11.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of interviewers. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, an integers NN the level of that interviewer. 

Output:
For each testcase, output a single integer WW, the number of ways to reach the interviewer's  level
Constraints

1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
2≤N≤402≤N≤40

Sample Input:

Sample Output:
1

2
3    
EXPLANATION:
Case 1: When the student is at level 1, there is only one way to reach level 2. By clearing one semester(1->2).
Case 2: To reach level 3, there are 2 ways. Either by directly clearing both the semester (1st way i.e., 1->3) or by clearing one semester at a time (2nd way 1->2->3). Total number of ways = 2.
Case 3: To reach level 4, there are 3 ways. 1st way (by clearing one exam at a time 1->2->3->4), 2nd way (clearing first semester and then clearing two semester at a time i.e., 1->2->4). 3rd way (first clearing two semesters in one time and then clearing single semester i.e., 1->3->4). Total number of ways = 3.
