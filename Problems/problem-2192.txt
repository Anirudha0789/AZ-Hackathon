You are given a number X. You have to make this number divisible by 2. The operations you can perform is as follows:
⦁    Add 1 to X
⦁    Substract 1 from X
You can perform these operations zero or more no of times. You have to find the minimum number of operations required to make X divisible by 2.  
Input:
t: Number of test cases
X: the given number  
Output:
The minimum number of operations required to make X divisible by 2  
Constraints:
1<=t<=1000
0<=X<=10^9  
Sample Input:
2
4
0  
Sample Output:
0
0  
Explanation:
Since 4 is divisible by 2 so the number of operation will be 0  
Since 0 is divisible by 2 so the number of operation will be 0
