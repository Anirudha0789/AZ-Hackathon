Chef has a secret recipe, represented by a set of NN non-negative integers (note that these integers must be pairwise distinct). Under the current circumstances, he has decided to give it away so that people can try it out at home. 
However, Chef is so fond of guessing games that he set one condition: he wants you to guess the integers in the recipe. In order to do that, you may ask Chef at most K=5,000K=5,000 queries. In each query, you choose a non-negative integer xx and Chef's response to this query is the element in the set that has the smallest bitwise XOR with xx (it can be proved that this element is unique).
Guess the elements of the set correctly and let the world know Chef's secret recipe!
Interaction

First, you should read a line containing a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for TT test cases follows.
For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer NN.
Then, you may ask queries.
To ask a query, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 11 and xx (0≤x<2600≤x<260).
Then, you must read a line containing a single integer ― the answer to your query, or −1−1 if the query is invalid or if you have asked too many queries.
Finally, you should print a single line containing the integer 22 followed by a space and NN space-separated integers ― the elements of the set in increasing order.
Then, you must read a line containing a single integer: 11 if your answer was correct, or −1−1 if it was incorrect. If your answer was correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.

Note that when you receive an answer −1−1, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Explanation
Example case 1: Chef's set is {2,3,7,10}{2,3,7,10}. In the first 3 queries, three exact elements of the set are asked, so Chef's answers are these elements themselves. In the last query, the element of the set which has the smallest XOR with 1111 is 1010. On the last line, the elements of the set are printed in increasing order (with a leading 22).
