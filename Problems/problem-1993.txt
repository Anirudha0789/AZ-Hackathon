The Cricket World Cup is currently taking place and there is high expectations on the Indian team to win the trophy. The conditions suggest that big scores are needed to win games. In order to score big, the batsmen need to score runs at a good strike rate. Given that a batsman has so far scored RR runs in BB balls, determine the minimum number of balls that he needs to face in order to attain a strike rate of SS or higher. Also, the batsman can face only 200 balls overall. So if it is not possible to reach the strike rate SS or higher within that, print -1. Assume that the batsman has complete control over the balls he faces and can score from 0 to 6 runs as he wishes in each delivery.
NOTE: Strike Rate refers to the number of runs the batsman is expected to score in 100 balls given the number of balls faced so far and the number of runs scored so far. Eg- If a batsman has scored 4 runs off 10 balls then his strike rate is 40 (He is expected to score 40 runs in 100 balls going at this rate).  
Input:

First and only line will contain three space separated integers RR , BB , SS 

Output:
Print the number of balls the batsman needs to face to attain the strike rate or more or print -1 if it is not possible.
Constraints

1≤B≤2001≤B≤200
0≤R≤6∗B0≤R≤6∗B
0≤S≤6000≤S≤600

Sample Input:
1 3 50

Sample Output:
1

EXPLANATION:
The batsman can score 1 or more runs off the next ball he faces and have a score of at least 2 runs from 4 balls which gives him a strike rate of at least 50. Hence the answer is 1 ball.
