Given an integer,N , traverse its digits (d1,d2,…,dn) and determine how many digits evenly divide N  (i.e.: count the number of times N divided by each digit di has a remainder of 0 ). Print the number of evenly divisible digits.
Note: Each digit is considered to be unique, so each occurrence of the same evenly divisible digit should be counted (i.e.: for N=111, the answer is 3).
Input:
The first line is an integer, T, indicating the number of test cases.
The  subsequent lines each contain an integer, N.
Output:
For every test case, count and print (on a new line) the number of digits in N that are able to evenly divide N.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 15
0 < N < 10^9
Sample Input:
   2
   12
   1012

Sample Output:
   2
   3
