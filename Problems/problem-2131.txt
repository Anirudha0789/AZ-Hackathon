Vijay is a very intelligent guy. To check his intelligence his teacher asked him a question and expects him to solve it as efficiently as possible, but since Vijay wants to spend some time with his girlfriend we asks for your help to solve it. Do remember his teacher will only reward him if the solution meets his expectations. 

You are given an integer N. Find the sum of Bitwise-Or of all ordered pairs (i,j):{1<=i,j<=N}. As the answer may be large compute it to modulo 10^9+7.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single integer N.

Output
For each test case print the required sum modulo 10^9+7.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 100000
1 <= N <= 1000000000

Example
Input:
1
2

Output:
9

Explanation
1|1+1|2+2|1+2|2=9
