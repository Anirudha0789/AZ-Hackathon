Given a few sentences and the word "yes", if she smiles, or "no", if she doesn't, print how many words makes her smile. (quotes for clarity).

Example: "you are pretty" doesn't make her smile. And "you are very pretty", makes her smile means the word "very" makes her smile.

Note: If she smiles at a sentence, then it would guarantee that there would be at least one word in that sentence that is not there in sentences that doesn't make her smile.
Input:
Input starts with an integer T, the number of test cases.

Each test case would have an integer S on a newline representing the number of sentences in that case. There would be S sentences after that, each on a newline, and between each sentence would be a word "yes" or "no" on a newline. Sentences would be words containing letters 'a' to 'z', inclusive, separated by single spaces. (Quotes for clarity).

Output:
Print the number of words that makes her smile for each case on a newline.
Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=S<=5
1<=characters in sentence<=100
