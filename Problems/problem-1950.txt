Chef has a string SS with length NN. He needs to find the number of indices ii (1≤i≤N−11≤i≤N−1) such that the ii-th character of this string is a consonant and the i+1i+1-th character is a vowel. However, he is busy, so he asks for your help.
Note: The letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' are vowels; all other lowercase English letters are consonants.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains a single string SS with length NN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of occurrences of a vowel immediately after a consonant.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤N≤1001≤N≤100
SS contains only lowercase English letters

Explanation
Example case 1: The vowel 'a' follows after the consonant 'b', 'e' follows after 'z' and 'i' follows after 'c', so the answer is 33.
Example case 2: The only vowel 'u' follows after 'b', so the answer is 11.
