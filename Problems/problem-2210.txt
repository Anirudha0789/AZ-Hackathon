Chennai Super Kings vs Royal Challenger Bangalore's match is near. Still 5 days left for the 
match. Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni decided to play a game where a ball will be given be any 
player and that player has to pass it to the target player by passing his teammates.
To play this game the players from two team(not necessary there are equal number of players on both the teams) is placed in a 2d matrix fashion.
But there are some rules:
1) if the position of a player is (i,j) then he can sent it to (i+1,j)th or (i,j+1)th or (i-1,j)th or (i,j-1)th player provided they are from same team
Chef is a big fun of MS Dhoni and he wants to find whether there exists any path such that CSK  wins the game.
Note
1) Remember the ball can be given to any player from either of the two team and each player can take the ball atmost once.
2)If the player of a team  having the ball  cannot pass the ball to the target position then the opponent team wins.
3) The initial player and the target player must belong to the same team for the team to win
