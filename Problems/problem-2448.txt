NOOB is in bizarre habit of counting everything. So one day he decided to count number of ways in which he can visit a very popular miraculous city Chefland. Chefland is a rooted tree consisting of nn vertices with the root at vertex 11. Vertex 11 is also the only entrance in Chefland and every leaf vertex contains an  exit door. But there is a problem. Some of the vertices are poisonous. If he visits consecutive mm poisonous vertices he will eventually die, otherwise he succussfully visits that city. NOOB feels some difficulties solving this problem and needs your in finding number of possible ways? 
Input:

First line contains two integers nn(number of vertices in chefland ) and mm(maximum number of consecutive poisonous cities).
Second line contains n integers a1,a2,a3...,aNa1,a2,a3...,aN where each aiai is either 11(if vertex is poisonous) otherwise 00.
Next n−1n−1 lines contains edges of the tree in the format of p1,p2p1,p2 where p1p1 and p2p2 are vertices of the tree connected by an edge.

Output:

print a single integer - maximum number of ways.
