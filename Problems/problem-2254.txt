Chef was working on building rail tracks connecting pairs of railway stations in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. There are NN stations on the xx-axis, with coordinates x1,x2,…,xNx1,x2,…,xN, and MM stations on the yy-axis, with coordinates y1,y2,…,yMy1,y2,…,yM. Chef has completed his task and built a rail track (line segment) between each pair of stations.
Now, Chef is wondering how many right triangles have the following property: the vertices are stations and the sides are railway tracks between them. Since Chef is busy with his other projects, help him answer this question.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers x1,x2,…,xNx1,x2,…,xN.
The third line contains MM space-separated integers y1,y2,…,yMy1,y2,…,yM.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of right triangles.

Explanation
Example case 1: There are no triplets where two stations lie on the xx-axis and one triplet where two stations lie on the yy-axis, which is ((0,2),(0,−8),(−4,0))((0,2),(0,−8),(−4,0)).
