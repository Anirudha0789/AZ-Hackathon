Omi gave Ish a 22-DD matrix AA of size NN * NN and asked him to find a 11-DD matrix BB of size NN where A[i][j]A[i][j] represents the logical ANDAND of B[i]B[i] and B[j]B[j]. Omi is smart enough and he know that logical ANDAND of a number with itself is that number so he filled the primary diagonal of the matrix with −1−1. As there are many ways to form the matrix BB, so you have to find the minimum possible sum of elements of matrix BB from all the different possible ways.
Input:

The first line of input contains the integer NN, size of the matrix.
Each of the following NN lines contains NN numbers AijAij , the elements of the matrix.

Output:

Output a single line integer, the minimum possible sum of elements of matrix BB.

Constraints

1≤N≤10001≤N≤1000
0≤A[i][j]≤1090≤A[i][j]≤109
Elements of matrix B must be non negative.

Sample Input:
 5
 -1 0 1 1 1
 0 -1 2 0 2
 1 2 -1 1 3
 1 0 1 -1 1
 1 2 3 1 -1

Sample Output:
 10

Explanation
Matrix BB for which sum of the elements is minimum and satisfying the matrix AA : [1,2,3,1,3][1,2,3,1,3]
