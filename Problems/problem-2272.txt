You are given a convex polygon PP with vertices P0,P1,…,Pn−1P0,P1,…,Pn−1, each having integer coordinates. On each edge PiP(i+1)%nPiP(i+1)%n of the polygon, choose a point RiRi uniformly at random. What is the expected area of the convex hull of these nn chosen points R0,R1,…Rn−1R0,R1,…Rn−1 ?
Note

Consider the area of the convex hull as zero if it contains less than 3 vertices.
All the points RiRi are chosen independently of each other.
Your answer is considered correct if and only if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10−610−6.

Input

The first line contains nn, the number of vertices in the convex polygon.
The next nn lines contain the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in anti-clockwise order. 

Output
For each testcase, print the expected area of the convex hull of the nn randomly chosen points.
Constraints

3≤n≤1053≤n≤105
The absolute values of all the coordinates ≤107≤107.
All the points in the input are distinct.
The described polygon PP is convex and the vertices of the polygon are given in anti-clockwise order. Also, no three vertices of the polygon are collinear.

Example Input
3
0 0
1 0
0 1

Example Output
0.1250000000
