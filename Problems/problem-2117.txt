"Skadoosh! " and now Po and Kai are in the spirit realm. They have a fierce battle and the dragon warrior emerges victorious with his new power of chi. Po meets Oogway after the battle and in order to return home, he must solve one of his mysterious puzzles.
Let’s define  a sequence  SS  as permutation of numbers from 11 to NN where NN is odd, so:
SS = {a1,a2,a3,…..ana1,a2,a3,…..an}. Let’s define another sequence:
XX = {a1⊕a2,a2⊕a3,…….an−1⊕ana1⊕a2,a2⊕a3,…….an−1⊕an}  where, ⊕⊕ is bitwise XOR operation.
Given sequence XX you have to restore sequence SS. 
Input:

The first line will contain TT, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains two lines NN in a first line followed by NN-11 space-separated integers. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the original permutation S. 
Constraints

1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
3≤n≤1053≤n≤105
Sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 107107

Sample Input:
1
3

3 1
Sample Output:
1 2 3

EXPLANATION:
XOR of 1 and 2 is 3, XOR of 2 and 3 is 1.
