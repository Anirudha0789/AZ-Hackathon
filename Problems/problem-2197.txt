Chef is very busy now-a-days. So, he has given you a task to  find the total count of all the number starting from 1 to n which are co-primes with n . For eg:- if y = 7 then there are 6 numbers which are co-primes with 7 . The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 .
Note:- a is co-prime with b means gcd (a, b) = 1.  
Constraints:
1 <= t <= 100
1 <= n <= 10^6
Input:
The first line contains a single integer t which denotes no of test cases. (1 <= t <=100) 
The second line contains a single integer n which denotes the range. (1 <= n <= 10^6).
Output:
Print the total count of all the numbers starting from 1 to n which are co-primes with n in the single line.  
Example : 1
Input:
1
7
Output:
6
Example-2
Input:
1
5
Output:
4
Explanation:
Total 4 numbers are there which are co-primes with 5. The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4.
