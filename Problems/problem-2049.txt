A balanced parenthesis string is defined as follows:

The empty string is balanced
If P is balanced, (P) is also 
If P and Q are balanced, PQ is also balanced

You are given two even integers nn and kk. Find any balanced paranthesis string of length nn that doesn't contain a balanced substring of length kk, or claim that no such string exists.
Input

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line containing nn and kk.

Output
For every testcase, print on a new line, any balanced paranthesis string of length nn that doesn't contain a balanced substring of length kk. If there doesn't exist any such string, print −1−1 instead.
Constraints

1≤T≤500001≤T≤50000
2≤k≤n≤1052≤k≤n≤105
Sum of nn over all testcases doesn't exceed 105105.
nn and kk are both even integers.

Example Input
2
4 2
8 6

Example Output
-1
(())(())

Explanation
In the first testcase, the only balanced strings of length 44 are (()) and ()(), both of which contain () as a substring.
In the second testcase, (())(()) is a balanced string that doesn't contain any balanced substring of length 66.
