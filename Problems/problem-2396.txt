There are NN villages numbered 11 to NN. The villages are connected through bi-directional paths in between them. The whole network is in the form of a tree. 
Each village has only 11 fighter but they help each other in times of crisis by sending their fighter to the village in danger through paths along the villages. Defeating a fighter will mean conquering his village. In particular, If village XX is under attack, all villages having a path to XX will send their fighters for help. 
Naruto wants to conquer all the villages. But he cannot take on so many fighters at the same time so he plans to use  a secret technique with which he can destroy  any 11 village (along with paths connected to it) in the blink of an eye.  However, it can be used only once. He realized that if he destroys any village, say XX, the maximum number of fighters he has to fight at once reduces to WW. He wants WW to be as small as possible. Help him find the optimal XX.
In case of multiple answers, choose the smallest value of XX.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First Line contains NN.
Next N−1N−1 lines contain U,VU,V, denoting a path between village UU and VV. 

Output:

For each Test case, print in a new line, optimal XX and corresponding value of WW.

Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
3≤N≤1053≤N≤105
1≤U,V≤N1≤U,V≤N 
U!=VU!=V 

Sample Input:
2
5
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 5
3
1 2
2 3

Sample Output:
1 2
2 1

EXPLANATION:
Sample 1:  By destroying village 11,  The fighters Naruto will be fighting at the same time will be from villages [2,4][2,4] and [3,5][3,5].  For this WW = 22. No other choice can give lesser WW. Hence 11 is optimal choice.
