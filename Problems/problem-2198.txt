You are given a number X. You have to tell the count of number that are power of two.
If a number is in the power of two, check for that number as well. Let X=2, we know 2 is a power of 2 and its power is 1. 1is also a power of 2 and its power is 0. So 1 is the only number which can be represented as a power of 2(2^1=2) and it is also in the power of 2(2^0=1).
Note: Here we don't consider 2.
Input:
t: Number of test cases
X: An given number  
Output:
The number of power of 2's which is a power of 2  
Constraints:
1<=t<=1000
1<=X<=10^6  
Sample Input:
2
3
16  
Sample Output:
0
3  
Explanation:
Since 3 is not power of 2 so the answer is 0  
16 is a power of 2. Its power is 4. 4 is a power of 2. Its power is 2. 2 is also a power of 2. Its power is 1.1 is also a power of 2. Its power is 0. Now 0 is not a power of 2. Since  4,2,1 are power of 2 therefore the answer is 3.
