The land of BITBIT is magical. It has islands covered by water around it.
The land here is denoted by '##' and water by '..'. The magical part of this place is that any person can walk on SpecialWaterSpecialWater. SpecialWaterSpecialWater are in those areas, which are adjacent to any piece of land (ie, share atleast one corner with any piece of land).
Mr.XMr.X being from normal land, finds it fascinating. So he decided to cover maximum number of cells only via SpecialWaterSpecialWater cells which are adjacent to each other, ie, share atleast one corner.
He was successful doing so. He wants to find how much distance he has covered. Help him find the maximum number of cells. 
Note: He can start from any cell.
Input:

First line will contain NN and MM, the size of the magical place.
