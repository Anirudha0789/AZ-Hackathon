Given a long integer xx, count the number of values of aa satisfying the following conditions:

a⊕x>xa⊕x>x
0<a<x0<a<x 

where aa and xx are long integers and ⊕⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator.
You are given qq queries, and each query is in the form of a long integer denoting xx. For each query, print the total number of values of aa satisfying the conditions above on a new line.
Input:

The first line contains an integer qq, where qq is the number of queries. 
Each of the next qq lines contains a long integer describing the value of xx for a query.

Output:
For each query, print the number of values of aa satisfying the given conditions on a new line.

EXPLANATION:
We perform the following q=2q=2 queries:   

For x=2x=2 the only value of aa satisfying 0<a<x0<a<x is 11. This also satisfies our other condition, as 1⊕2=31⊕2=3 and 3>x3>x. Because we have one valid aa and there are no more values to check, we print 11 on a new line.
For x=10x=10, the following values of aa satisfy our conditions:
1 ⊕ 10 = 11
4 ⊕ 10 = 14
5 ⊕ 10 = 15
6 ⊕ 10 = 12
7 ⊕ 10 = 13
There are 55 valid values of aa.
