The people of Vestland regularly play a game. They have blocks each denoting some integer from 0 to 9. These are arranged together in a random manner without seeing to form different numbers keeping in mind that the first block is never a 0. Once they form a number they read in the reverse order to check if the number and its reverse are the same. If both are the same then the player wins. We call such numbers palindrome.
Ash happens to see this game and wants to simulate the same on the computer. As the first step, he wants to take input from the user and check if the number is a palindrome and declare if the user wins or not. 
(A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when written forward or backward. eg:11,121,262,9449,17371…….)
Input:
The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines containing an integer N.
Output:
For each input-output "wins" if the number is a palindrome and "loses" if not, in a new line.
Constraints
1<=T<=20
1<=N<=20000
Sample Input:
   3
   331
   666
   343

Sample Output:
   loses
   wins
   wins
