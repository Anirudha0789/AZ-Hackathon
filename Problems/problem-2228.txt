The chef knows very well that in maximum cases a * b >= a+b but not in every case so he wonders how many different pairs he can make from n given numbers such that ai * aj < ai+aj.
As the chef is not good in mathematics so he asked you to help him to find the number of pairs he can make.
Input Format:
First line contains t the number of test cases
For each test case, you are given one Integer n the size of the array.
Next line contain n space separated integers (a1,a2,a3…….an). 
Output Format
For each test cases print the number of pair which satisfy the above condition.
Constraints:
1 <= t <= 50
1 <= n<= 200000
0 <= ai <= 10^9
The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.
Sample Input
2
1
64
5
1 56 0 0 65 
Sample Output
0
8
Explanation of test case 2 : pairs are {[1,56] , [1,0] , [1,0] , [1,65] , [56,0] , [56,0] , [65,0] , [65,0]}
