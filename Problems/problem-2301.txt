Sondesh likes Triangles very much except Bermuda triangle. Her Personal Assistant Meaw likes polygon. Once she found a magic stick box. Then she made NN triangles in a way that:

All the triangles are same and congruent
All the triangle connects to at least one common point
Triangles will never overlap each other.

Suddenly Sondesh figured out that she made a Regular polygon with those triangle. She told her Meaw to count all the sticks in that polygon and not to count if the formation is not a polygon.

Sondesh Can use so many sticks and create a big formation. She will help Meaw by telling the number of triangle NN. 
Can you help Meaw by saying how many stick was used in that polygon?
Input:
First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single integer, NN - Number of triangles in the formation. It can be possible that Sondesh had not been able to form a single triangle
Output:
For each testcase, output a single integer deonoting number of sticks used by Sondesh. 
If Sondesh failed to make a polygon print −1−1.
Constraints:

1≤T≤1041≤T≤104
0≤N≤1060≤N≤106

Sample Input:
2
1
6

Sample Output:
3
12
