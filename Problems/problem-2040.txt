Dr.D is now fond of matrices. He is particularly interested in Doofish Matrices. A Doofish Matrix of order NN is a matrix with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and NN columns (numbered 11 through NN) such that:

Each element of this matrix is an integer between 11 and 2N−12N−1 inclusive.
For each ii and jj (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N, 1≤j≤2N−11≤j≤2N−1), the integer jj appears in the ii-th row and/or in the ii-th column.

Now, for a given NN, Dr.D is wondering if there is a Doofish Matrix of order NN. Find such a matrix or determine that it does not exist. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN.

Output
For each test case:

First, print a line containing the string "Hooray" if a Doofish Matrix of order NN exists or "Boo" if it does not.
If it exists, print NN more lines describing one such matrix. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain NN space-separated integers ― the elements in the ii-th row.

Constraints

1≤T≤2,0001≤T≤2,000
1≤N≤2,0001≤N≤2,000
the sum of N2N2 over all test cases does not exceed 4⋅1064⋅106
