Naruto wants to visit NN villages. Since he is busy, he will be sending his clones instead. He can make as many clones as he wants. In fact, his clones can also make clones. In particular, two villages are connected if there is a path in between them.
Each village has a number between 11 to NN (inclusive). They are connected by paths. The whole network of village is in the form of a tree with its root being village 11. On the first day, Naruto sends a clone to village 11. The clone stays there for the day and on the next day, it multiplies into  KK clones, where KK is equal to the number of unvisited villages connected to the current villages the clone is in. Then, 11 clone is sent to each of the unvisited villages. The process is repeated for each village until all villages are visited. If no unvisited villages are connected to a village, then the clone simply disappears after paying the visit.
Assume that it takes no time in making clones and going from 11 village to other.
The clones take energy from the real Naruto so he would want to be prepared for the day when the number of clones will be maximum. Help him find this day. In case there is more than 11 answer, print the one with the lowest day number.
Input:

First line contains NN, the number of villages.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers xx and yy denoting that villages xx and yy are connected by a path.

Output:

Print, in a new line, the day on which there will be the maximum number of clones.  In case there is more than 1 answer, print the one with the lowest day number.

Explaination
On day 11, there is only one clone. On day 22, the clone multiplies into 33 and 11 clone goes to each of the villages 22,33 and 44. Hence there are 33 clones on day 22. For day 33, clones in village 22 and 44 dissapear, clone in village 33 multplies into 11 which goes to village 55. Hence there is 11 clone on day 33. Thus answer is 22.
