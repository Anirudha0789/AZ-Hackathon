There are NN circles in a plane. Circle ii and circle jj form a good pair if it is possible to choose a point P1P1 on the perimeter of circle ii and a point P2P2 on the perimeter of circle jj such that the Euclidean distance between P1P1 and P2P2 is exactly KK. (Note that P1P1 and P2P2 do not need to have integer coordinates.)
You should answer QQ queries. In each query, you are given the required distance KK. Chef is interested in finding the number of good pairs of distinct circles for each query. Please help him.
Note: Circle ii and circle jj are distinct when i≠ji≠j. There may be any number of circles that coincide (have identical centers and radii).
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ denoting the number of circles and the number of queries respectively.
Each of the following NN lines contains three space-separated integers XX, YY and RR describing a circle with radius RR and center (X,Y)(X,Y).
Each of the next QQ lines contains one integer KK describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good pairs of circles.

Explanation
The distance between the point (0.00,−5.00)(0.00,−5.00) on circle 11 and the point (8.00,1.00)(8.00,1.00) on circle 22 is 1010. There is no pair of points on these two circles with distance 00 or 2020.
