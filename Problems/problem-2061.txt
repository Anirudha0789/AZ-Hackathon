A long time ago, a grid with NN rows and NN columns had mysteriously vanished. The cells of this grid contain integers 11 through N⋅NN⋅N in some order. You do not know this order, but some information remains to this day: MM pairs of cells with Manhattan distance 11 or 22.
You should find a grid satisfying the following conditions (or decide that it does not exist):

The cells of the grid contain all integers from 11 to N2N2.
For each given pair (u,v)(u,v), the cells containing uu and vv have Manhattan distance 11 or 22.
There are no other pairs of cells with Manhattan distance 11 or 22.

If there are multiple possible solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
Each of the following MM lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv describing a pair of cells at distance 11 or 22.

Output
For each test case:

If there is no solution, print a single line containing the integer −1−1.
Otherwise, print NN lines containing NN space-separated integers each. The jj-th integer on the ii-th line should denote the number in the ii-th row and jj-th column of the grid.

-1

Explanation
Example case 1: Note that there are many possible solutions.
Example case 2: A solution satisfying all constraints on given pairs may exist, but there would always be some other pair of cells with distance 11 or 22 too.
