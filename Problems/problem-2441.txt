There are protests going on in the state all around !!!!!! :(  .
To reduce the violent nature of Protests,
The government has decided to Barricade  Bi-directional roads ,By placing a Barricade  on a Bi-directional  road it will turn to uni-directional road,
you being the only Advisor of your state , you realized that there would be transport issues for primary protocols in the town  which are economically very costly , so you decided that  even after placing Barricades , it should be possible to reach each city from every other city , your task is to find the maximum number of bi-directional roads that can be considered for Barricading.
NOTE : To begin with there is some way from each city to every other city and there can be multiple Bi-directional roads between two cities
Sample Map of the state:

Input:

First line will contain Two space separated integers N,MN,M, number of cities and Bi-directional Roads
Next M lines follow two space separated  Integers a and b , which is a road between city a and city b

Output:
Output a single Integer the maximum number of roads which can be considered for Barricading .
Constraints

2≤N,M≤2∗1052≤N,M≤2∗105
1≤a,b≤2∗1051≤a,b≤2∗105
it is guaranteed that a is not equal to b

Sample Input:
3 3

1 2
2 3
3 1
Sample Output:
3

EXPLANATION:

1< ------ > 2 <------ > 3 <----> 1 
In this case the you can convert it to 1 ----- > 3 ----- >2 ----- > 1, and there is way   from each city to every other city 
another possibility is 1< -----3 < ------2< ----- 1, so each road can be considered for Barricading
