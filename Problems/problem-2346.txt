  The description of this problem is extremely simple. You are given 2
  non-intersecting circles in 3-dimensional world. Each of the circle is defined
  by 3 non - collinear points lying on the circle. All you have to return is
  whether the circles are entangled or not (just like two links of a chain). Two
  circles are entangled if they cannot be separated from each other without
  breaking any of the circles.
  
Input Format:

  The first line contains a single integer, T, the number of test cases. Each of
  the T test cases are defined by 2 lines. The first line of each test case
  contains 9 integers representing the 3 points as (x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2),
  (x3, y3, z3) which define the first circle. Similarly, the second line for
  each test case contains 9 integers representing the 3 points which define the
  second circle.
  
Output Format:

  For every query output "YES" without quotes if the circles are entangled and
"NO" otherwise (quotes for clarity).
  
Constraints:

  1 ≤ T ≤ 100
