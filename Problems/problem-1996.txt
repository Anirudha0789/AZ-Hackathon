Alice wants to test Bob's love for the number 77.
Alice gives Bob a sequence of integers A=[A1,A2,…,AN]A=[A1,A2,…,AN], and  QQ queries. In each query, she provides an integer KK and asks bob to find the number of lovely subsequences of size KK that can be formed from AA.
A sequence BB of length KK is called lovely if, for every subsequence SS of BB, the following condition holds:

If |S||S| is divisible by 77, then the sum of SS should also be divisible by 77.
If |S||S| is not divisible by 77, then the sum of SS should also not be divisible by 77.

where |S||S| denotes the length of SS.
Help Bob answer the queries. Since the answers can be very large, print them modulo 109+7109+7.
Note: Two subsequences are considered distinct if the indices chosen to form them are distinct, even if their elements end up being the same. For example, A=[1,1,2,2]A=[1,1,2,2] has 44 subsequences of length 11 (two are [1][1] and two are [2][2]) and 66 subsequences of length 22.
Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ — the size of the array and the number of queries, respectively.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN — the elements of the array AA.
Then, QQ lines follow. The ii-th of these lines contains a single integer KK, the parameter for Alice's ii-th query.

Output Format

For each query, output on a single line the answer modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation
Let's look at the first test case.
Query 11: Here, K=3K=3 so we look at subsequences of length 33. There are 1010 such subsequences, but the only lovely subsequences of length 33 are [4,5,6],[1,4,5][4,5,6],[1,4,5] and [2,4,6][2,4,6]. For example,

[1,2,4][1,2,4] is not lovely because its sum is 77 but its length isn't divisible by 77.
[1,2,5][1,2,5] is not lovely because it has [2,5][2,5] as a subsequence, which has a sum of 77 but its length is not divisible by 77.

Similarly, it can be verified that other than the three mentioned subsequences, none of the other length 33 subsequences are lovely.
Query 22: Here, K=5K=5. The only subsequence to consider is the entire array itself. It can be seen that the sequence [1,2,4,5,6][1,2,4,5,6] isn't lovely (because it contains [1,2,4][1,2,4], for example).
