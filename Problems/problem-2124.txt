You are given an integer sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
Let's define a transformation ff. Applying ff on AA gives a new sequence f(A)=[B1,B2,…,BN]f(A)=[B1,B2,…,BN], where BN=ANBN=AN and Bi=Ai⊕Ai+1Bi=Ai⊕Ai+1 for each valid ii.
Next, let's denote the sequence obtained by starting with AA and applying the transformation kk times by fk(A)fk(A). Formally, f0(A)=Af0(A)=A and fk+1(A)=f(fk(A))fk+1(A)=f(fk(A)) for any integer k≥0k≥0.
You should answer QQ queries. In each query, you are given two integers KK and XX; the answer to this query is fK(A)XfK(A)X, i.e. the XX-th element of the sequence fK(A)fK(A).
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
Each of the next QQ lines contains two space-separated integers KK and XX describing one query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to this query.
