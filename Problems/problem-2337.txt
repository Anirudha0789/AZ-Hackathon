A room had K snooker tables of various sizes. Every snooker table is a rectangle of size M x N, and the table does not contain any pockets.
The edges of each table are described as L (left),  R (right),  U (up) and D (down). The left and right edges are of length M, and the up and down edges are of length N.
Origin of each rectangle is the intersection of L and D.
A player enters the room and plays a move on every table.
The following actions are performed in a move:

 Player places the ball at Origin.
 Player strikes the ball at angle 45o with D.
Every edge has certain number of points associated with it.
Whenever the ball collides with an edge, the player gets the points associated with that edge.
The total points obtained by the player for a table is the sum of points he gets for each collision.
Considering that the ball traverses length X, calculate the number of points obtained by the player on each table.

Note:

 The table is frictionless.
 The ball does not lose any energy after collision with the table.
 The ball abruptly stops after it travels length X.
 If the ball strikes the intersection of two edges (i.e., a corner), the player gets points associated with both edges and the ball rebounds along the same line along which it reached the corner.
 The ball follows the laws of reflection.
 Assume the ball to be a point object
 Assume sqrt(2) to be 1.41

Input
The first line consists of an integer K
The second line consists of an integer X
2*K lines follow
Each table is described by 2 lines:
First line contains 2 space seperated integers M and N.
Second line consists of 4 space-separated integers L R U D, where each integer describes the points associated with the respective edges: left, right, up and down.

Output
Output K lines, each containing an integer where the ith line represents the number of points obtained by the player for the ith table
 
Constraints
1<=K<=10^5
1<=X<=sqrt(2)*10^4
1<=M,N<=1000
1<=L,R,U,D<=10^4
