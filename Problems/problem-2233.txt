NehaNeha want to reach a destination but she decide that she can make moves in two directions only. If NehaNeha is at position (x,y)(x,y) , then she can move to (x+1,y+1)(x+1,y+1)  or (x+1,y)(x+1,y). NehaNeha must start her journey from (0,0)(0,0) and her destination is (X,Y)(X,Y) . Your task is to find the minimum number of moves that NehaNeha require to reach the destination or if she cannot reach the destination.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers X,YX,Y. 

Output:
For each test case, print a single line denoting the minimum number of moves that NehaNeha must take to reach the destination. Print -1 if she cannot reach the destination.
Constraints

1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
|X|,|Y|≤10e9|X|,|Y|≤10e9

Sample Input:
1
1 0
Sample Output:
1
EXPLANATION:
NehaNeha can take step from (x,y) to (x+1,y) .
So she can take step from (0,0) to (1,0).
Number of moves is 1 and is the optimal solution.
