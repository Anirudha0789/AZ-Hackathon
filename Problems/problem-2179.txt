Chef has been given an array word consisting of N strings, he wants to return the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. Which means the strings word[i] and word[j] contain no common characters.
If no such two words exist in the given array, Chef should return 0.
Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Next line contains length of the array "N".
The 2nd line of each test case contains the space separated words present in the array.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in an integer.
Constraints

1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
2≤N≤2≤N≤1000
1≤words[i].length≤1≤words[i].length≤1000
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
                        Sample Input 1

abcw baz foo bar xtfn abcdef

                        Sample Output 1
                        

16
Explanation
The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn", as they have no common characters in it. Therefore, the product of the length of both the strings = 4 * 4 = 16 is maximum among all possible pairs.
