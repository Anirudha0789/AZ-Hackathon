"Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light."
Harry already had a terrifying experience against the dementors. To protect himself against the dementors, he spent the winters mastering a spell SS with Professor Remus Lupin. He had learned that the lexicographically smaller the spell SS, the more powerful it is.
Harry and Sirius Black were fighting dementors near the Great Lake. But since the number of dementors were way too large therefore he had to make the spell as powerful as possible.
Now, he can change the spell SS to S′S′ (making it stronger) by using mm passes of the form (c1c1,c2c2).
In each pass, he can change any character c1c1 of the spell to c2c2.
To defeat all the dementors he has to create the most powerful spell possible by using any of the given mm passes as many times as he want.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Next line of each test case contains two integers nn and mm, the length of the string and the number of passes.
Next line contains the spell SS.
Next mm lines contain 22 characters c1c1, c2c2.

Output:
For each test case on a new line print the most powerful spell S′S′ that Harry can create using the mm passes any number of times.
