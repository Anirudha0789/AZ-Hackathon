Naruto is done visiting all the villages. It turns out that this was a secret mission to collect data that might be useful.
Naruto found out that each village belongs to a group GG. Let's define GiGi as the group to which the ithith village belongs. As we already know, The whole network of villages is in the form of a rooted tree, where each village represents a vertex, with village 11 being the root vertex. In particular, 22 villages are connected if there is a path in between them.
This grouping might be a threat to Naruto's own village so he wants to be prepared for the worse. The threat level of a group in village ii  is the number of villages belonging to that group in the subtree of the village ii. 
Naruto is only concerned with the highest threat level. For each village, find the highest threat level.
Input:

The First line will contain NN, number of villages.
The Second line contains NN space-separated integers G1,G2,G3,....,GNG1,G2,G3,....,GN, where GiGi is the group to which the ithith village belongs.
Next N−1N−1 lines contain 22 space-separated integers xx and yy denoting that villages xx and yy are connected by a path.

Output:
Print NN space-separted integers A1,A2,..,ANA1,A2,..,AN, where AiAi denotes the highest threat level of the ithith village

Explanation:
If you draw the tree with its group name you will observe that root 11 has 33 number of 2′s2′s and 22 number of  3′s3′s in its subtree, so threat level is 33.  Vertex 22 has one 22 and two 3′s3′s in its subtree, so threat level is 22. Vertex 33,44 and 55 have only one 22, one 33 and one 33, so threat level for vertex 3,4,53,4,5 will be 1,1,11,1,1.
